This is one of multiple CCNA quiz based videos, these quizzes are practical and use packet

1
00:28.790 --> 00:36.160
tracer to help you test and verify your knowledge of CCNA topics.

2
00:36.310 --> 00:43.630
So download the attached packet tracer file and see if you can practically answer the questions

3
00:43.660 --> 00:45.020
in this quiz.

4
00:45.130 --> 00:55.020
So don't just answer the questions prove it by using the packet tracer simulation mode. So assume

5
00:55.230 --> 01:01.590
that for these questions that all devices have just rebooted you can simulate this by clicking the

6
01:01.590 --> 01:05.920
power cycle devices button in Packet Tracer.

7
01:05.980 --> 01:12.440
In other words, you can click this button here to power cycle the devices.

8
01:12.640 --> 01:16.930
Again don't just answer these questions prove it.

9
01:16.930 --> 01:24.100
The first question is, when PC 1 pings PC 4 in network 1

10
01:24.160 --> 01:27.770
what type of packet is sent to the Hub initially?

11
01:27.790 --> 01:28.680
Can you prove it?

12
01:29.630 --> 01:31.670
Who received the packet?

13
01:31.910 --> 01:34.980
Who received the return traffic from PC 4 to 

14
01:34.970 --> 01:45.090
PC 1 and when ping traffic is sent from PC 1 to PC 4 who receives that traffic? For question

15
01:45.090 --> 01:46.530
5 to 8

16
01:46.530 --> 01:53.140
assume that the switches and MAC address table is empty so assume that this layer 2 switch

17
01:53.140 --> 01:59.450
network 2 has just rebooted and that its MAC address table is empty.

18
01:59.610 --> 02:02.600
When PC 5 pings PC 8,

19
02:02.850 --> 02:09.330
in other words this PC here pings the IP address of PC 8 what type of packet is sent initially to

20
02:09.330 --> 02:10.350
the switch

21
02:10.500 --> 02:12.110
and can you prove it?

22
02:12.210 --> 02:19.500
And then again who receives the initial packet and who receives the return traffic from PC 8 to PC 

23
02:19.500 --> 02:29.930
5? And then when ICMP traffic or ping traffic is sent from PC 5 to PC 8 who received the traffic? Question

24
02:29.930 --> 02:36.270
9 10 and 11 ask about broadcast and collision domains.

25
02:36.350 --> 02:41.460
How many broadcast domains are there in network one and can you prove it?

26
02:41.480 --> 02:46.390
How many broadcast domains are there in network 2 and can you prove it?

27
02:46.400 --> 02:50.570
How many collision domains are there in network 1 and network 2

28
02:51.020 --> 02:58.610
and again can you prove that? You don't have to answer these questions from Question 1 to question eleven.

29
02:58.700 --> 03:05.240
You may wanna answer questions 9 10 and 11 first and then answer the other questions.

30
03:05.240 --> 03:13.460
But by the time you finished you should be able to answer these 11 questions and be able to prove the

31
03:13.460 --> 03:15.230
answers practically.

32
03:15.350 --> 03:21.980
So download the attached packet tracer file and see if you can answer the questions yourself.

33
03:22.250 --> 03:26.930
But I'm now gonna go through the answers to these questions.

34
03:27.110 --> 03:29.840
I'm gonna answer the questions practically now.

35
03:29.840 --> 03:32.930
So either pause the video or continue watching.
