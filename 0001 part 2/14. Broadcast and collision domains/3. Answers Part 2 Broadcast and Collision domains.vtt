00:19.720 --> 00:27.450
We can also answer this question, How many broadcast domains are there in network 1?

1
00:27.570 --> 00:35.700
So if I go back all the way to the original ARP message and then click capture forward the ARP message

2
00:35.690 --> 00:39.060
is sent to the Hub.

3
00:39.090 --> 00:42.580
Notice it's a broadcast at layer 2.

4
00:42.600 --> 00:53.730
So what happens to broadcast traffic it gets flooded so we have one broadcast domain because a broadcast

5
00:53.790 --> 00:58.120
sent to a hub is flooded.

6
00:58.910 --> 01:03.390
So single broadcast domain in network 1

7
01:06.380 --> 01:15.140
we can also prove that by rerunning a simulation so let's rerun the simulation.

8
01:15.260 --> 01:24.620
I'm only going to look at ARP and ICMP traffic but on PC 1 what I'm gonna do now is send a broadcast

9
01:24.680 --> 01:35.900
to 10 11 255 so this is a broadcast, I'll only send two packets notice the broadcast traffic is sent

10
01:35.930 --> 01:48.800
to the hub when we look at the packet, source address is PC 1 we can see that again by looking at the

11
01:48.860 --> 01:50.480
MAC address.

12
01:50.480 --> 01:56.610
So notice the MAC address is PC 1, destination is a broadcast.

13
01:56.960 --> 02:05.780
So the destination MAC address is set to that destination IP address is set to a broadcast 255 255 255

14
02:06.370 --> 02:07.500
in Packet Tracer.

15
02:07.700 --> 02:14.850
Source IP address is PC 1. Notice the broadcast goes to everyone.

16
02:14.850 --> 02:23.320
So it's a single broadcast domain these devices will reply back but the traffic is flooded out of all

17
02:23.320 --> 02:24.370
ports.

18
02:24.370 --> 02:33.920
Notice we're getting a collision here so I'll reset the  simulation and let's look at another problem

19
02:35.170 --> 02:51.380
if PC1 sends a ping to PC 4 and PC 2 sends a ping to PC 4 what's going to happen? So they're

20
02:51.380 --> 02:54.530
both sending packets into the network.

21
02:57.990 --> 02:58.760
In this example

22
02:58.760 --> 03:12.790
PC 2 send an ARP, because it doesn't know the MAC address of PC 4 so here's the actual frame.

23
03:13.030 --> 03:22.270
A quick recap of terminology to be precise and to be correct for the CCNA exam at layer 1 on the

24
03:22.270 --> 03:23.460
OSI model.

25
03:23.560 --> 03:31.630
We talk about bits at layer 2 in the OSI model we talk about frames at layer 3 we talk

26
03:31.630 --> 03:39.400
about packets and at layer 4 we talk about segments and then we typically talk about data at

27
03:39.400 --> 03:41.050
higher layers.

28
03:41.050 --> 03:48.520
I'm often using terms interchangeably here but if you wanna be very precise about terminology at 

29
03:48.520 --> 03:56.110
layer 1 it's bits, layer 2 its frames, layer 3 it's packets at layer 4 it's segments.

30
03:56.110 --> 04:00.990
So notice at layer 2 the frame has a destination address of a broadcast.

31
04:03.350 --> 04:09.980
That's causing problems with the frame that was sent by PC 1.

32
04:10.040 --> 04:17.660
We've got a collision taking place here so there's a problem with the frames because of the collisions,

33
04:18.770 --> 04:24.530
only one device can access the network at any time. So here

34
04:24.540 --> 04:31.260
PC 1 is sending the ICMP message and a reply is sent back to PC 1

35
04:34.180 --> 04:39.100
so run the simulation again, before I do that

36
04:39.100 --> 04:49.720
I'm gonna make sure that PC 2 can ping PC 4 make sure that it's ARP cache is populated so

37
04:49.720 --> 04:50.670
both

38
04:50.800 --> 05:02.770
PC 2 and PC1 have PC 4s MAC address in the ARP cache and then what I'll do in simulation mode

39
05:03.550 --> 05:15.130
is get PC 1 to ping PC 4 and get PC 2 to ping PC 4 so they both can send an ICMP packet.

40
05:16.750 --> 05:20.470
When that hits the hub we have a collision.

41
05:20.860 --> 05:24.490
You have a single collision domain when you have a hub.

42
05:24.910 --> 05:31.830
So a hub is a single broadcast domain as well as a single collision domain.

43
05:31.870 --> 05:38.620
We're gonna have problems with lots of collisions taking place as you add more and more devices to

44
05:38.620 --> 05:39.790
a hub.

45
05:39.790 --> 05:42.120
So be careful with hubs.

46
05:42.250 --> 05:50.320
They are single collision domains and single broadcast domains so we can save for question 11, network

47
05:50.320 --> 05:56.770
1 equals a single collision domain.

48
05:56.770 --> 06:06.160
Be careful using hubs today we don't use hubs in wide infrastructures we use switches which we'll see

49
06:06.160 --> 06:07.030
in a moment.

50
06:07.090 --> 06:09.430
Have multiple collision domains.
