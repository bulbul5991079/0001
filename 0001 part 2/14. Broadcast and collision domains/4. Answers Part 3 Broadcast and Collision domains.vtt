00:19.940 --> 00:25.280
In question 5 we're told to assume that switch 1s MAC address is empty.

1
00:25.870 --> 00:37.090
We can verify that by looking at the output of the show MAC address table command on the switch, as we

2
00:37.090 --> 00:39.500
can see here the MAC address table is empty.

3
00:40.400 --> 00:48.310
We're asked when PC 5 pings PC 8 what type of packet is sent to the switch initially

4
00:48.580 --> 00:50.100
and can we prove it?

5
00:50.380 --> 00:50.950
So

6
00:53.620 --> 01:01.000
IP config on PC 5 shows us the IP address of PC 5, 10 115

7
01:01.270 --> 01:02.150
PC 8

8
01:04.720 --> 01:08.630
has IP address 10 118.

9
01:08.690 --> 01:15.430
So what kind of frame or what kind of packet is sent to the switch when using terms such as frames and

10
01:15.430 --> 01:25.070
packets once again, are we referring to layer 2 or layer 3 or layer 4 of the OSI model.

11
01:25.090 --> 01:32.720
So what I'll do on PC 5 is ping 10 118 before I do that,

12
01:32.750 --> 01:35.960
notice the ARP cache is empty.

13
01:35.960 --> 01:41.880
On PC 5 if it had just a rebooted the ARP cache would be empty.

14
01:41.920 --> 01:49.580
So I'm gonna send two pings into the network we can see that the first packet that was generated is

15
01:49.580 --> 01:59.780
an ARP packet looking at the actual packet or frame we can see that at layer 2 the frame has a destination

16
01:59.780 --> 02:01.100
address of a broadcast.

17
02:02.130 --> 02:10.530
The type of packet at layer 3 is ARP, so in the layer 3 headers we can see that this is an ARP packet

18
02:11.460 --> 02:23.840
requesting the MAC address of host with IP address 10 118 so the Ethernet type is 06 08 06.

19
02:23.860 --> 02:28.280
In other words it's an ARP packet, capture forward

20
02:31.200 --> 02:43.360
and before I continue the answer to Question 5, is this is an ARP packet it's a broadcast packet we can

21
02:43.360 --> 02:51.100
see that again by looking at the inbound PDU on the switch notice destination address is a broadcast

22
02:52.190 --> 03:00.170
who receives the packet because it's a broadcast it's gonna be flooded to the other devices in the

23
03:00.170 --> 03:09.970
network and then PC 6 and PC 7 are gonna drop it because the packet is not destined to them.

24
03:09.970 --> 03:12.650
So the answer for question 6 is

25
03:12.700 --> 03:20.860
PC 6, PC 7 and PC 8 will receive the packet.

26
03:20.970 --> 03:22.400
Now here's where things change,

27
03:22.410 --> 03:26.140
who receives the return packet?

28
03:26.160 --> 03:33.450
So here we've got our ARP reply on the inbound PDU to the switch.

29
03:33.450 --> 03:37.290
We can see that the target mac address is this,

30
03:37.440 --> 03:43.330
that's the MAC address of PC 5.

31
03:43.420 --> 03:48.290
So the MAC address is actually written into the frame.

32
03:48.310 --> 03:54.120
This is a uni cost packet sent from PC 8 to PC 5.

33
03:54.220 --> 03:59.790
It's not a broadcast unlike the ARP request so notice what happens now.

34
04:01.930 --> 04:05.790
The packet is only sent to PC 5

35
04:05.860 --> 04:16.960
it's not flooded out of all ports so the only PC that receives it is PC 5 that is different to

36
04:16.960 --> 04:27.460
our previous example where PC 1, PC 2 and PC 3 received the return traffic and notice the difference

37
04:27.520 --> 04:34.320
in question 8 when ping traffic is sent from PC 5 to PC 8 who receives it.

38
04:34.450 --> 04:35.160
So here's our

39
04:37.720 --> 04:51.790
ICMP request or echo request message we can see that its ICMP destination MAC address is PC 8, 

40
04:51.870 --> 04:56.040
source MAC address is PC 5 source IP address is

41
04:56.040 --> 05:00.150
PC 5 destination IP address is PC 8.

42
05:00.250 --> 05:10.670
So notice now that the packet is only sent to PC 8, so that's very different to what we saw when we

43
05:10.670 --> 05:19.130
were using a hub, a switch is different to a hub in that it has a separate collision domain on every

44
05:19.130 --> 05:30.190
port so when packets are sent from PC 5 to PC 8 they are sent directly between the devices they don't

45
05:30.730 --> 05:34.270
get flooded to the other PCs in the network.

46
05:34.270 --> 05:44.080
That is very different to a hub so to prove that what I'll do is populate the ARP cache of PC 6.

47
05:44.660 --> 05:45.890
So I'll get it to ping

48
05:46.000 --> 05:56.730
PC 8 and I'll run this in real-time so if we look at to the ARP cache of PC 6 ARP cache is populated

49
06:01.860 --> 06:05.160
the same is true on PC 5.

50
06:05.410 --> 06:06.000
So both

51
06:06.000 --> 06:15.180
PC 5 and PC 6 know the MAC address of PC 8. I'll change this to simulation mode

52
06:16.410 --> 06:21.980
and I'll get both of these PCs to ping PC 8

53
06:27.060 --> 06:30.090
both of them are sending ICMP packets

54
06:30.090 --> 06:32.130
they both get sent to the switch.

55
06:33.980 --> 06:41.170
And notice the first one is sent to PC 8 and then the second one is sent to PC 8.

56
06:41.170 --> 06:52.490
We don't end up with a collision so the switch caches the packet and allows the communication and

57
06:52.490 --> 06:54.300
to show you this in a different way.

58
06:54.320 --> 07:00.380
What I'll do is get PC 5 to ping PC 8

59
07:02.900 --> 07:14.140
but get PC 6 to ping PC 7. So PC 5 is pinging PC8, PC 6 is pinging PC 

60
07:14.190 --> 07:21.920
7, in this case, PC 6 needs to ARP for the MAC address of PC 7.

61
07:22.030 --> 07:29.960
Notice however that there is no collision taking place.

62
07:30.090 --> 07:41.520
So now notice the ARP cache of PC 6 is populated with the MAC address of both PC 7 and PC 8. So I'll

63
07:41.520 --> 07:42.750
run that again

64
07:46.310 --> 07:49.370
and I need to be in simulation mode to do that.

65
07:51.830 --> 07:54.770
So they're both are sending ICMP packets

66
07:57.520 --> 07:59.300
these are unicast

67
07:59.340 --> 08:09.780
they are not broadcasts, notice the destination of this frame is PC 7 destination of this frame

68
08:10.650 --> 08:22.860
is PC 8 both packets can be sent and received by the switch without interference from the other conversation

69
08:25.000 --> 08:34.590
so the PCs can communicate now without collisions and they are essentially separated from the other

70
08:34.590 --> 08:42.900
conversation. The conversation between PC 5 and PC 8 happens independently of the conversation between

71
08:42.900 --> 08:45.900
PC 7 and PC 6.

72
08:45.930 --> 08:49.610
We have 4 collision domains here

73
08:53.840 --> 09:04.350
a hub is a single collision domain, a switch has a collision domain per interface, but again if PC 5

74
09:04.440 --> 09:05.730
sent a broadcast

75
09:09.950 --> 09:11.120
the broadcast

76
09:14.540 --> 09:20.240
would be forwarded to all devices in the network.

77
09:20.240 --> 09:21.770
This is a layer 2 switch

78
09:21.770 --> 09:29.810
it's gonna flood that broadcast out of all ports so everyone is gonna receive the broadcast and

79
09:29.870 --> 09:35.090
everyone is gonna have to reply back to that broadcast.

80
09:39.460 --> 09:46.220
Packet tracer is not perfect software but it allows you to visually see how traffic flows in the network

81
09:46.700 --> 09:53.480
and to learn how to answer questions such as these.

82
09:53.570 --> 10:01.550
So when studying for the CCNA exam you can use packet tracer to learn how traffic flows to learn what

83
10:01.550 --> 10:08.090
frames look like, what packets look like, what segments look like and it helps you essentially become

84
10:08.150 --> 10:10.430
a better network engineer.

85
10:10.490 --> 10:12.890
So were you able to answer these questions?

86
10:13.130 --> 10:20.360
Do you understand how data flows in a network when you have a switch or when you have a hub?

87
10:20.600 --> 10:24.920
Make sure that you understand how data flows through networks.
