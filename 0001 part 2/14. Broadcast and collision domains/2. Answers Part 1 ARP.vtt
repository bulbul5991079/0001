Okay, so let's see if we can practically answer these questions.

1
00:23.950 --> 00:31.420
To do that I'm gonna use simulation mode in packet tracer and I'm gonna change the filters to

2
00:31.480 --> 00:36.160
only show ARP and ICMP messages.

3
00:36.160 --> 00:44.170
I don't wanna see all the other traffic types in the network. So let's see what happens when PC 1 pings 

4
00:44.170 --> 01:02.420
PC 4. PC 1 has an IP address of 10 111, PC 4 has an IP address of 10 114 so we're going

5
01:02.420 --> 01:04.700
to send ICMP traffic

6
01:04.700 --> 01:05.960
in other words ping traffic

7
01:08.670 --> 01:16.150
from PC 1 to PC 4 and then we're going to observe what happens. Now in this example

8
01:16.150 --> 01:18.890
I'll only send two packets.

9
01:19.030 --> 01:28.410
In other words two pings, notice what happens in the network there's ICMP traffic but there is also an

10
01:28.440 --> 01:31.520
ARP frame that's generated.

11
01:31.650 --> 01:37.110
PC 1 needs to learn the MAC address of PC 4

12
01:37.320 --> 01:47.820
so it sends out an ARP which is a broadcast requesting the target MAC address of PC 4. So in answer

13
01:47.820 --> 01:51.320
to our first question, what type of packet is sent

14
01:51.330 --> 01:58.250
initially? The answer is a ARP packet which is a broadcast packet.

15
02:02.170 --> 02:08.280
We've proven that by running simulation mode in Packet Tracer.

16
02:08.290 --> 02:16.510
Now this is a broadcast and in this network, the devices are connected to a hub so the traffic should

17
02:16.510 --> 02:25.670
be flooded to all devices in the network except the device that sent the packet.

18
02:25.670 --> 02:27.500
So who receives the packet?

19
02:27.530 --> 02:28.510
PC 2 does, 

20
02:28.520 --> 02:41.380
PC 3 does and so does PC 4, PC 2 and PC 3 will drop the packets because the ARP packet is not for

21
02:41.530 --> 02:52.830
their IP address, PC 2 as an example is configured with IP address 10 112 so PC 2 is gonna drop the

22
02:52.830 --> 02:53.660
packet.

23
02:53.910 --> 03:04.010
The ARP request is for IP address 10 114 so both PC 2 and PC 3

24
03:04.020 --> 03:14.360
drop the packet but PC 4 will accept the packet and what it should do now is send back an ARP reply.

25
03:14.750 --> 03:27.400
So if we look at this packet notice the inbound packet to the hub is an ARP reply packet with the MAC

26
03:27.400 --> 03:32.020
address of PC 4 this is PC 4s IP address

27
03:32.050 --> 03:34.090
this is its MAC address.

28
03:34.090 --> 03:46.170
We can verify that by using the IP config command and I should say IP config slash all notice the MAC

29
03:46.170 --> 03:55.650
address which is the source MAC address of the frame and that's the source MAC address we see over here.

30
03:55.650 --> 04:00.120
So the next question is, who receives the return traffic?

31
04:00.120 --> 04:11.180
So if I click capture forward notice PC 1, PC 3 and PC 2 receive the return traffic so it PC

32
04:11.180 --> 04:13.300
1, PC 2 and PC 3.

33
04:13.490 --> 04:23.740
PC 2 and PC 3 will drop the ARP reply because it's not destined to them when we look at that packet

34
04:24.580 --> 04:33.320
we can see that the destination MAC address is PC1 and we can confirm that by looking at the config

35
04:33.320 --> 04:44.420
of PC1 notice the MAC address is this, so PC2 and PC 3 will drop the ARP

36
04:44.410 --> 04:53.840
reply. We're then asked when ping traffic is sent from PC 1 to PC 4 who receives the traffic.

37
04:53.840 --> 04:58.280
Now it's a hub so the traffic will be flooded.

38
04:58.440 --> 05:10.320
So here's the ICMP message we can see that it's an Ethernet 2 frame using IP 4 at layer 3 and

39
05:10.320 --> 05:16.440
we can see it's an ICMP packet and when we click capture forward notice

40
05:16.550 --> 05:29.850
PC 2, PC 3 and PC 4 receive the traffic but again PC 2 and PC 3 will drop the packet because

41
05:29.850 --> 05:40.670
it's not destined to them when we look at the inbound PDU or protocol data unit on PC 4 we can

42
05:40.670 --> 05:47.880
see that the destination IP address is PC 4 and the destination MAC address is

43
05:47.880 --> 05:58.270
PC 4 we can verify that once again by using the IP config slash all command and we can see the MAC

44
05:58.270 --> 05:59.170
address of

45
05:59.170 --> 06:02.950
PC 4. So that's going to continue now

46
06:03.410 --> 06:03.980
When the

47
06:03.980 --> 06:08.320
PC 4 replies to PC 1

48
06:08.400 --> 06:15.660
the traffic is flooded and this is the problem with the hub even though the conversation is between

49
06:16.110 --> 06:23.480
PC 1 and PC 4 everyone in the network receives the traffic.
