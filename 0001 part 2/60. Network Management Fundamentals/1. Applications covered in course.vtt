In this course, I'm going to demonstrate multiple solar winds, applications, including network performance

1
00:06.090 --> 00:14.460
monitor or NPM, Kiwi Syslog server, Kiwi CatTools, and others that may be of interest to you.

2
00:15.180 --> 00:19.310
Please give feedback if there's any tool that you'd like to add to the course.

3
00:19.980 --> 00:26.340
But before we get into the demonstrations, it's important that you understand the protocols that these

4
00:26.340 --> 00:29.700
applications rely on to manage the network.

5
00:30.620 --> 00:39.380
So you need a knowledge of protocol such as ICMP, SNMP or Simple Network Management Protocol, SNMP

6
00:39.380 --> 00:50.600
Traps, Syslog and WMI, these protocols enable applications such as NPM to access devices in GNS3 

7
00:50.840 --> 00:55.940
or in a production topology and to extract information from those devices.

8
00:57.010 --> 01:02.950
So it's important that you, as a network engineer or network manager, have an understanding of these

9
01:02.950 --> 01:03.790
protocols.

10
01:04.740 --> 01:10.680
If you already know what SNMP is or what Syslog is feel free to skip ahead, but in this video, I'm

11
01:10.680 --> 01:12.660
going to discuss some of these protocols.
