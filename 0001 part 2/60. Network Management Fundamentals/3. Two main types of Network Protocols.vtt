Now, there are two main types of network management protocols that you should be aware of when studying

1
00:06.780 --> 00:10.410
network management protocols and how to manage your network.

2
00:10.890 --> 00:18.030
Always think about how the protocols work and the advantages and disadvantages of the two main types

3
00:18.030 --> 00:25.890
of network management protocols, the two types of query based, which means that the network management

4
00:25.890 --> 00:31.470
station or NMS asks a question from a device and then waits for a response.

5
00:32.340 --> 00:40.230
And then you have event-based protocols where the network management station simply listens for announcements

6
00:40.230 --> 00:42.450
or events from the network.

7
00:43.360 --> 00:49.720
So with query-based, the network management station is sending a query to a router to extract information

8
00:49.720 --> 00:57.010
from that router, whereas with event-based protocols, a router or switch would inform the network management

9
00:57.010 --> 01:03.540
station of an issue or of something taking place as an example, an interface goes down

10
01:03.670 --> 01:04.570
that's an event

11
01:05.080 --> 01:10.390
and a message is sent to the network management station to inform the network management station of

12
01:10.390 --> 01:11.920
that event taking place.
