When you deploy a network management system, it's typically going to add an overhead to your network.

1
00:06.690 --> 00:12.930
This is especially true if you're using a query-based system that's polling the network using a very

2
00:12.930 --> 00:13.860
short interval.

3
00:14.670 --> 00:20.610
So you should determine the scope and impact on the network that the network management system will

4
00:20.610 --> 00:21.000
have.

5
00:21.910 --> 00:27.970
So, as mentioned, one of the things you need to think about is polling frequency, this means how

6
00:27.970 --> 00:31.350
often you're going to poll devices to collect data.

7
00:32.200 --> 00:37.540
The more often that you poll devices, the more granular and the more detailed your statistics are

8
00:37.540 --> 00:38.050
going to be.

9
00:39.020 --> 00:45.650
However, on the flip side, that means that it's going to have a larger impact on your network because

10
00:45.650 --> 00:47.990
there's more traffic being transmitted on the network.

11
00:48.800 --> 00:53.330
The network management system is polling the network on a more frequent basis, which puts more traffic

12
00:53.330 --> 00:54.070
on the network.

13
00:54.650 --> 01:00.290
And in addition, there's a higher load on your network devices because they have to reply back to the

14
01:00.290 --> 01:05.640
network management station with information that you're trying to gather from that network device.

15
01:06.590 --> 01:14.840
So more polling equates to more detail and quicker detection of issues, but it puts a higher load on

16
01:14.840 --> 01:17.870
both the network and the devices in your network.

17
01:18.710 --> 01:25.610
Now, once again, the advantage of more polling is that you have more detail and it's quicker to detect

18
01:25.610 --> 01:26.120
issues.

19
01:26.700 --> 01:30.920
However, on the flip side, it can create extra traffic on the network.

20
01:31.850 --> 01:38.810
Now, most modern network management systems and a lot of modern network devices can handle a larger

21
01:38.810 --> 01:43.190
amount of network management traffic than was possible in the past.

22
01:44.000 --> 01:49.760
The processing power of your network devices and the speed of interfaces are a lot greater today than

23
01:49.760 --> 01:50.990
they were a few years ago.

24
01:51.880 --> 01:55.330
So it's not as much of a problem as it may have once been.

25
01:56.300 --> 02:01.400
This is another reason that you want to leverage both event-based network management protocols, as

26
02:01.400 --> 02:07.970
well as query-based network management protocols, event-based protocols once again offer real-time

27
02:07.970 --> 02:11.480
unsolicited feedback from your network devices.

28
02:11.990 --> 02:15.560
A router is going to inform the network management station

29
02:15.560 --> 02:22.760
when an interface goes down with polling-based or query-based protocols, there's a query and response.

30
02:23.570 --> 02:29.660
In other words, the NMS is querying a device for information, and it's responding or answering

31
02:29.660 --> 02:31.430
back to that query.

32
02:32.330 --> 02:40.910
Now, less polling equates to less bandwidth utilization, but in addition equates to smaller storage

33
02:40.910 --> 02:44.540
requirements, which is another important thing to think about.

34
02:45.540 --> 02:51.000
If you're collecting a large amount of data, you need to think about your disk requirements for your SQL

35
02:51.000 --> 02:58.980
Server, which is where NPM stores data, large amounts of data equate to bigger SQL databases, which

36
02:58.980 --> 03:01.080
in turn means that you need more disk space.
