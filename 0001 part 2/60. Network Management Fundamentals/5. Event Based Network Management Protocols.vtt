In event-based system, the network management protocols, work very differently to query-based systems.

1
00:07.920 --> 00:14.760
In any event-based system, the network management system simply listens for possible announcements

2
00:14.760 --> 00:17.100
or events to be sent over the wire.

3
00:17.970 --> 00:24.420
Typically, network management protocols that leverage these types of events are either syslog based or

4
00:24.420 --> 00:25.860
SNMP Trap based.

5
00:26.710 --> 00:33.660
Now, they are controllable in terms of the amount of detail that you receive from devices on your network.

6
00:34.510 --> 00:41.170
So as an example, on a Cisco router, you could enable debugging, which produces a very large amount

7
00:41.170 --> 00:41.660
of data.

8
00:42.580 --> 00:46.600
There's a lot of low-level detail that's generated with the debugging.

9
00:47.410 --> 00:52.510
You may not necessarily want that amount of data pushed to your network management system.

10
00:53.320 --> 00:59.560
One of the issues here is if you receive a large amount of data, who's going to sift through the data

11
00:59.890 --> 01:03.670
to make meaningful decisions on the data that was received?

12
01:04.450 --> 01:09.940
So you don't want to just enable lots of event-based information that's sent to you a Syslog server.

13
01:10.930 --> 01:16.530
One of the advantages of event-based systems is that they can react very quickly.

14
01:17.080 --> 01:22.870
In other words, if any event takes place on the network, the network management system can act on that

15
01:22.870 --> 01:27.510
event immediately rather than waiting for a polling interval to expire.

16
01:28.480 --> 01:35.350
As an example, if you were polling a router interface for its status every five minutes, then you would

17
01:35.350 --> 01:42.330
know that that interface is up whenever the poll is done or query is done in a query-based system.

18
01:43.180 --> 01:49.420
But if the interface goes down just after you pulled it, it may take another five minutes for you to

19
01:49.420 --> 01:51.760
realize that the interface went down.

20
01:52.600 --> 01:58.900
When your network management system polls the router every five minutes, it will receive back a positive

21
01:58.900 --> 02:05.680
response from the router, confirming that the interface is up as an example that's typically done using

22
02:05.680 --> 02:07.930
a network management protocol such as SNMP.

23
02:08.770 --> 02:12.520
So you know the interface is operational because you've queried the router.

24
02:13.300 --> 02:16.570
If you don't get a response from the router, then you know there's a problem.

25
02:17.440 --> 02:22.750
But the downside of a query-based system is that you're only polling it every five minutes.

26
02:23.260 --> 02:30.070
If the interface went down immediately after you had pulled the router, it could take up to five minutes

27
02:30.520 --> 02:37.240
for you to realize that there's a problem on the interface of that router. Whereas in an event-based

28
02:37.240 --> 02:43.480
system and SNMP Trap or Syslog message is sent immediately when the interface goes down.

29
02:43.960 --> 02:49.720
So in this case, the router is informing the network management system that there's a problem rather than

30
02:49.720 --> 02:56.050
the network management system having to wait a five minute interval to query the router for the status

31
02:56.050 --> 02:56.860
of an interface.

32
02:57.820 --> 03:04.150
Now, there is a downside to event-based systems, the network management protocols are not reliable

33
03:04.480 --> 03:11.260
because the network management system is simply passively waiting and listening for events to be sent

34
03:11.260 --> 03:11.820
to it.

35
03:12.700 --> 03:18.700
It wouldn't know if there was a problem on the network if that event didn't reach the network management

36
03:18.700 --> 03:19.100
system.

37
03:19.930 --> 03:26.470
So there's a network issue or an interface went down that prevents the Syslog message or SNMP Trap

38
03:26.830 --> 03:29.110
from getting to the network management system.

39
03:29.830 --> 03:36.550
The network management system would be unaware of the problem without explicitly polling the network

40
03:36.550 --> 03:37.210
device.
