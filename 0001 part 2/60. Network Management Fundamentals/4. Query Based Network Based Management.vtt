There are several advantages and disadvantages to why you'd want to use a query-based network management

1
00:06.480 --> 00:07.110
protocol.

2
00:08.090 --> 00:15.710
Firstly, query-based protocols are reliable because it's query-based, the network management station

3
00:15.710 --> 00:24.470
is queering or asking for information from a network device. If the NMS doesn't receive a response

4
00:24.560 --> 00:27.280
from the device, that indicates a problem.

5
00:28.160 --> 00:34.220
The fact that the NMS made a query and didn't get back a response indicates that there's a problem

6
00:34.220 --> 00:34.970
on the network.

7
00:35.900 --> 00:43.730
So no response equates to a problem query-based, also called polling-based network management protocols

8
00:44.000 --> 00:47.650
can be scheduled and you can set how frequently that's done.

9
00:48.530 --> 00:55.460
So you could pull the network on a very frequent basis or pull the network less frequently to reduce

10
00:55.460 --> 00:57.500
the impact of the queries on the network.

11
00:58.250 --> 01:05.300
As an example, you may not necessarily want to query a network device every five seconds because of

12
01:05.300 --> 01:07.200
the overhead that you're putting on the network.

13
01:08.030 --> 01:16.040
Now, in Orion Network Performance Monitor or Orion NPM also referred in this course to as solarwinds

14
01:16.040 --> 01:16.640
NPM.

15
01:17.650 --> 01:24.460
The default setting is two minutes for query-based polls for status information and nine minutes for

16
01:24.460 --> 01:26.680
query based polling firm statistics.

17
01:27.770 --> 01:32.450
Orion NPM uses both query and event based protocols.
