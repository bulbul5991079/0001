00:05.370 --> 00:07.200
-: Now there's no better way for you to learn

00:07.200 --> 00:09.570
than to follow along practically.

00:09.570 --> 00:12.030
So make sure that you've got Wireshark downloaded

00:12.030 --> 00:15.600
and installed, and that you open the PCAP files

00:15.600 --> 00:18.150
that I've attached to this course.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.280
Now I'm going to demonstrate stuff practically

00:20.280 --> 00:21.930
using GNS3.

00:21.930 --> 00:24.150
But rather than you trying to build this topology

00:24.150 --> 00:26.220
and replicate what I've done,

00:26.220 --> 00:28.770
you can simply download the PCAP files

00:28.770 --> 00:30.330
and then follow along.

00:30.330 --> 00:34.050
The PCAP files that I'm sharing are the actual captures

00:34.050 --> 00:35.580
that I'm gonna do now.

00:35.580 --> 00:39.060
So you'll be able to follow along and also use Wireshark

00:39.060 --> 00:41.760
to see the results that I get.

00:41.760 --> 00:46.300
In this topology I've got two Windows PCs, PC1 and PC2.

00:47.850 --> 00:50.463
So here's PC1, here's PC2.

00:52.890 --> 00:56.340
PC1 has IP address, 10.1.1.1,

00:56.340 --> 00:59.400
default gateway's 10.1.1.254,

00:59.400 --> 01:01.950
which is the router in the topology.

01:01.950 --> 01:06.950
PC2 has IP address, 10.1.2.1,

01:08.010 --> 01:11.580
default gateway is 10.1.2.254,

01:11.580 --> 01:14.160
which is the router in the topology.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.660
So I'm simulating an entire network here in GNS3,

01:18.660 --> 01:21.270
and I'm gonna show you how to capture packets,

01:21.270 --> 01:22.200
or capture frames,

01:22.200 --> 01:24.810
and we'll talk about those terms in a moment,

01:24.810 --> 01:27.630
and then you'll be able to see what's going on.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.330
I've also got a server in this topology.

01:30.330 --> 01:34.350
The server is a web server, FTP server, TFTP server,

01:34.350 --> 01:36.270
and runs other services.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.820
So what I'll do is send traffic

01:38.820 --> 01:43.230
from the hosts to each other, so PC1 to PC2 back again.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.990
And also from the PCs to the server.

01:45.990 --> 01:48.510
And then have a look at the captured packets

01:48.510 --> 01:51.600
and hopefully you'll be able to see what's going on

01:51.600 --> 01:54.630
and get an understanding of the frames, packets,

01:54.630 --> 01:55.830
segments, and so forth.

01:55.830 --> 01:59.493
And also get an understanding of how to use Wireshark.

01:59.493 --> 02:02.076
