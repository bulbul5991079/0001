00:00.240 --> 00:01.350
-: In this video, I'm gonna show you how to

00:01.350 --> 00:04.860
download and install Wireshark on a Mac.

00:04.860 --> 00:08.250
If you haven't got a Mac, then skip this video.

00:08.250 --> 00:11.070
But if you want to see how to install Wireshark on a Mac,

00:11.070 --> 00:13.080
I'm gonna show you that here.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.320
The first thing you need to do is go to Wireshark.org

00:16.320 --> 00:20.190
This is the official website and click download.

00:20.190 --> 00:22.530
In my example, I'm gonna download

00:22.530 --> 00:26.730
Wireshark for Mac Os 10.12 and later.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.380
So click on that link,

00:28.380 --> 00:32.250
that then downloads the software to my local computer.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.950
It's a fairly simple installation.

00:35.220 --> 00:38.370
Basically go to the website, click download

00:38.370 --> 00:40.230
and then download the software.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.600
I'm gonna open it when it's finished.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.300
And then it's a fairly simple installation.

00:45.300 --> 00:50.130
Okay so, the package file or DMG file is being opened

00:50.130 --> 00:51.033
and verified.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.623
I'm gonna double click on the package file,

00:58.710 --> 01:00.063
that's being verified.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.530
And now I can follow the Installation wizard.

01:04.530 --> 01:07.380
Basically all I'm gonna do is

01:07.380 --> 01:11.130
click next, next, next and install the software.

01:11.130 --> 01:13.350
I'm going to put my password in,

01:13.350 --> 01:15.093
to allow it to be installed.

01:17.130 --> 01:19.530
The software is now being installed on my computer,

01:19.530 --> 01:23.310
and as you can see, that has successfully completed.

01:23.310 --> 01:25.680
I'm gonna keep the DMG file for the moment

01:25.680 --> 01:26.943
and close this window.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.330
I'm gonna open up a finder window and go to applications,

01:33.330 --> 01:35.913
and search for Wireshark.

01:38.490 --> 01:39.690
So there it is,

01:39.690 --> 01:42.243
I'm gonna right click and click open.

01:44.490 --> 01:46.590
And notice, there I'm able

01:46.590 --> 01:50.070
to start capturing traffic in Wireshark.

01:50.070 --> 01:52.590
I'm gonna double click on ethernet interface

01:52.590 --> 01:57.183
and notice I can now capture traffic in Wireshark.

01:58.230 --> 02:00.480
I'll just search for ARP here,

02:00.480 --> 02:03.720
notice I can see ARP messages from a

02:03.720 --> 02:07.443
Cisco router ARPing for a specific IP address.

02:08.580 --> 02:11.940
So, a lot of broadcast ARP traffic there.

02:11.940 --> 02:15.603
But basically I'll be able to see traffic on the network.

02:22.050 --> 02:24.660
Including Dropbox syncing,

02:24.660 --> 02:28.470
so syncing protocol this on VNC, traffic actually,

02:28.470 --> 02:29.523
on the network.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.013
Here's ARP, once again.

02:33.210 --> 02:36.243
Here's TLS, so encrypted web traffic.

02:38.010 --> 02:40.563
Bunch of traffic being sent on the network.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.160
But that's an example of how to

02:44.160 --> 02:47.820
install Wireshark on a Mac.

02:47.820 --> 02:49.860
In subsequent videos I'm gonna show you

02:49.860 --> 02:52.320
how to use Wireshark more effectively

02:52.320 --> 02:54.120
than just grabbing all traffic.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.710
I'll stop at this capture,

02:55.710 --> 02:57.540
and then close Wireshark down,

02:57.540 --> 03:00.183
but I won't save the captured file.

03:01.290 --> 03:02.280
Okay, so there you go.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.883
That's how you download and install Wireshark on a Mac.
