00:00.000 --> 00:02.833
(energetic music)

00:04.740 --> 00:05.573
-: Now in this course,

00:05.573 --> 00:07.710
we are mainly using Cisco Packet Tracer

00:07.710 --> 00:09.330
to simulate networks.

00:09.330 --> 00:12.450
Cisco Packet Tracer is fantastic software.

00:12.450 --> 00:15.390
It allows us to simulate all kinds of networks.

00:15.390 --> 00:18.090
We can simulate routers, we can simulate switches,

00:18.090 --> 00:21.030
we can simulate wireless access points,

00:21.030 --> 00:22.920
wireless LAN controllers,

00:22.920 --> 00:25.050
all kinds of devices can be simulated

00:25.050 --> 00:26.970
using Cisco Packet Tracer,

00:26.970 --> 00:28.680
but it's a simulator.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.200
It doesn't actually show us what's happening

00:31.200 --> 00:32.970
in a real network.

00:32.970 --> 00:35.130
It gets us a long way there.

00:35.130 --> 00:36.152
Fantastic software

00:36.152 --> 00:39.060
for building virtual networks on your laptop,

00:39.060 --> 00:40.740
but if you really wanna see

00:40.740 --> 00:42.960
what's actually happening on a network,

00:42.960 --> 00:45.660
you need to use something like Wireshark.

00:45.660 --> 00:49.230
So in this course I'm gonna show you Wireshark captures

00:49.230 --> 00:52.470
and we are gonna dig deep into the packets.

00:52.470 --> 00:55.050
We are going to look at applications such

00:55.050 --> 00:57.780
as HTTP, FTP and others.

00:57.780 --> 01:00.660
I'm gonna show you how you can capture passwords

01:00.660 --> 01:03.000
off the wire or off the air

01:03.000 --> 01:05.010
if you are using a wireless network.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.710
So basically, Wireshark is what's called

01:07.710 --> 01:09.360
a protocol analyzer.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.910
It captures traffic off the wire

01:11.910 --> 01:15.420
and allows you to view packets that have been sent

01:15.420 --> 01:18.090
by either your device or other devices.

01:18.090 --> 01:21.540
If you use a mode called Promiscuous Mode.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.050
Basically, Wireshark is a fantastic tool

01:25.050 --> 01:28.020
that network engineers use to analyze networks

01:28.020 --> 01:30.584
and find out if there are problems on a network.

01:30.584 --> 01:33.540
(energetic music)

01:33.540 --> 01:36.870
In this example, it's gonna be voiceover IP traffic.

01:36.870 --> 01:39.450
In other words, we are gonna capture traffic

01:39.450 --> 01:42.990
between virtual phones as shown here

01:42.990 --> 01:46.050
as well as virtual phones and physical phones.

01:46.050 --> 01:48.570
I'm gonna make calls between these two phones

01:48.570 --> 01:50.580
and then we are gonna capture the traffic

01:50.580 --> 01:53.340
and then replay the voice call.

01:53.340 --> 01:55.830
And we are gonna use Wireshark for that.

01:55.830 --> 02:00.830
This is my second call, David Bombal speaking to himself.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.553
Click "Play streams" and there's our voice call.

02:06.637 --> 02:11.637
"This is my second call, David Bombal speaking to himself."

02:13.590 --> 02:15.180
Now to make it easier for you,

02:15.180 --> 02:16.950
rather than you trying to build

02:16.950 --> 02:19.890
some of the networks that I've created in this course,

02:19.890 --> 02:22.830
I've captured the packets in Wireshark

02:22.830 --> 02:24.840
and I've attached them to the course.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.200
So all you need to do is download the Wireshark captures

02:28.200 --> 02:31.860
and then you can follow along and follow what I'm doing.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.020
So you can actually try this yourself.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.510
Rather than trying to build a whole network,

02:36.510 --> 02:39.450
capture the packets and then try and follow along,

02:39.450 --> 02:42.030
you can simply download the Wireshark captures.

02:42.030 --> 02:44.040
So I've made this a lot easier for you.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.780
Just download the Wireshark captures

02:45.780 --> 02:48.150
and then you can try this yourself.

02:48.150 --> 02:51.450
Now obviously if you want to try this in your networks,

02:51.450 --> 02:54.090
either at home or in the office and so forth,

02:54.090 --> 02:55.830
but be careful.

02:55.830 --> 02:58.950
You need to have permission to capture traffic,

02:58.950 --> 03:01.590
especially if you're gonna be capturing passwords.

03:01.590 --> 03:03.960
So don't just go and capture any traffic anywhere.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.760
You could land in trouble.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.230
So make sure that you have permission

03:07.230 --> 03:08.940
to capture the packets of a network

03:08.940 --> 03:11.100
if it's not your own private network.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.690
Okay, so in the next video

03:12.690 --> 03:15.840
I'm gonna show you how to download Wireshark,

03:15.840 --> 03:17.760
how to install it on a Windows computer

03:17.760 --> 03:20.190
and I'll also show you how to install it on a Mac.

03:20.190 --> 03:21.180
And then I'm gonna show you

03:21.180 --> 03:23.130
how to interpret Wireshark captures,

03:23.130 --> 03:25.020
a really important skill to have.

03:25.020 --> 03:29.070
It's important that you know how to read Wireshark captures.

03:29.070 --> 03:30.720
So I'm introducing this now.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.310
It's quite a complex topic.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.450
You may struggle.

03:33.450 --> 03:36.180
Now, please don't worry if you struggle initially.

03:36.180 --> 03:39.660
All of us initially struggle with new technologies.

03:39.660 --> 03:43.230
Keep on studying, keep on learning, do the labs.

03:43.230 --> 03:45.593
That's probably the best advice I can give you.

03:45.593 --> 03:49.740
Keep on trying, keep on learning and you'll get it.

03:49.740 --> 03:51.930
Okay, so that's enough said about Wireshark.

03:51.930 --> 03:52.763
In the next video

03:52.763 --> 03:55.191
I'm gonna show you how to download and install Wireshark.

03:55.191 --> 03:58.024
