WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:02.220
-: In this video, I'm gonna show you how to download

00:02.220 --> 00:05.850
and install Wireshark on a Windows computer.

00:05.850 --> 00:08.100
The process is fairly intuitive.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.160
First thing you need to do is open up a web browser

00:11.160 --> 00:14.733
and go to wireshark.org.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.740
This is the official Wireshark website

00:19.740 --> 00:22.710
so simply browse to wireshark.org

00:22.710 --> 00:24.540
and then click download.

00:24.540 --> 00:26.820
You then need to select the installer.

00:26.820 --> 00:27.653
In my example,

00:27.653 --> 00:30.273
it's gonna be a Windows installer 64 bit.

00:31.110 --> 00:33.690
I'm gonna save that to my local computer.

00:33.690 --> 00:36.510
If you're still running a 32 bit Windows operating system,

00:36.510 --> 00:37.920
you could select that,

00:37.920 --> 00:40.200
but I'm running Windows 10 here,

00:40.200 --> 00:42.840
64 bit operating system.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.010
I'm gonna open up the folder

00:46.260 --> 00:49.053
and then double click on the installation file.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.853
Click yes to start the installation process.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.750
And now I'm simply gonna just choose all the defaults.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.730
So click next.

00:59.730 --> 01:03.060
Now Wireshark is open source software.

01:03.060 --> 01:07.170
It's licensed under the GNU General Public License

01:07.170 --> 01:08.880
so you don't have to pay for Wireshark,

01:08.880 --> 01:11.730
but you need to agree to this license.

01:11.730 --> 01:14.160
Click agree to continue.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.070
I'm gonna install all the default components

01:17.070 --> 01:18.330
and click next.

01:18.330 --> 01:22.140
I'm also going to add a Wireshark desktop icon

01:22.140 --> 01:23.580
to my desktop.

01:23.580 --> 01:24.690
Click next.

01:24.690 --> 01:27.360
I'm gonna stay with the default installation directory.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.560
Click next.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.650
Click next again and click install.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.390
So basically all I did there

01:33.390 --> 01:36.543
was go through the default installation process.

01:38.850 --> 01:42.960
Now what Wireshark will do is add information

01:42.960 --> 01:45.030
to your network adapters.

01:45.030 --> 01:47.673
So at the moment, I've only got network adapter two.

01:51.060 --> 01:55.053
So you can see here, I've got Ethernet0 network two,

01:58.380 --> 02:00.150
but that will be updated.

02:00.150 --> 02:03.930
I'm going to agree to the Nmap installation.

02:03.930 --> 02:05.910
And again, just select the defaults

02:05.910 --> 02:06.993
and click install.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.760
You can look at the details if you like.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.090
Otherwise just wait for the installation to complete.

02:15.090 --> 02:16.690
It's a very simple installation.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.270
Going back through the installation,

02:21.270 --> 02:25.470
notice this installing Npcap Loopback adapter.

02:25.470 --> 02:30.470
So now, I've got this Npcap Loopback adapter

02:31.890 --> 02:34.200
that gets installed automatically.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.003
Click next, click finish.

02:38.580 --> 02:40.770
The Wireshark installation now completes.

02:40.770 --> 02:43.260
So notice it's extracting a bunch of files

02:43.260 --> 02:45.840
and installing Wireshark.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.730
The Wireshark software is now installed

02:47.730 --> 02:49.620
and you can see that's completed.

02:49.620 --> 02:52.560
Click next and click finish.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.020
So I've got Wireshark installed

02:55.020 --> 02:56.220
and I could run it,

02:56.220 --> 02:58.090
so I'll simply type Wireshark here

02:58.950 --> 03:01.143
and run the desktop application.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.250
So there you go.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.680
You can see various network adapters.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.620
So my Npcap Loopback adapter

03:10.620 --> 03:12.720
and my Ethernet0 adapter.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.090
That's the one that I want to capture traffic on

03:15.090 --> 03:16.980
so I'm simply gonna double click it.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.110
And as you can see now,

03:19.110 --> 03:21.450
it's starting to capture traffic.

03:21.450 --> 03:24.630
Now it's capturing a lot of traffic on my local network,

03:24.630 --> 03:26.730
including Dropbox traffic.

03:26.730 --> 03:29.910
What I'll do however, is go to a website

03:29.910 --> 03:31.540
such as cisco.com

03:33.870 --> 03:38.310
and then in Wireshark, I'll stop this capture

03:38.310 --> 03:40.890
and do a filter for HTTP.

03:40.890 --> 03:42.450
And what you can see here

03:42.450 --> 03:45.393
is I've been able to capture HTTP traffic.

03:46.350 --> 03:47.490
I can move these around

03:47.490 --> 03:49.653
so that's easier to read what's going on.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.053
But notice HTTP or hyper text transfer protocol,

03:55.960 --> 03:57.840
we can see this is actually traffic coming

03:57.840 --> 03:59.553
from a Microsoft website.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.743
So stuff is being sent to Microsoft.

04:07.140 --> 04:09.150
But notice here, HTTP.

04:09.150 --> 04:10.810
So there's my HTTP get

04:11.790 --> 04:13.290
and then I'm getting a message saying

04:13.290 --> 04:15.720
that the website has been moved.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.300
Basically, I'm being redirected

04:18.300 --> 04:21.930
to an HTTPS website

04:21.930 --> 04:24.660
rather than going to pure HTTP

04:24.660 --> 04:27.990
which is insecure, shouldn't be using it,

04:27.990 --> 04:31.470
I'm being redirected to a encrypted website.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.850
So hence being told

04:32.850 --> 04:34.860
that the website has been moved

04:34.860 --> 04:36.090
because I'm gonna be pushed

04:36.090 --> 04:37.920
to a encrypted website

04:37.920 --> 04:41.913
rather than using an insecure website.

04:43.110 --> 04:46.530
But the point is is that I can connect to the internet.

04:46.530 --> 04:49.860
Here's some traffic to amazontrust.com.

04:49.860 --> 04:52.710
So a whole bunch of stuff happening in the background

04:52.710 --> 04:54.450
on my network,

04:54.450 --> 04:57.900
but were you able to capture some traffic in your example?

04:57.900 --> 05:01.650
As always, be careful capturing traffic on a network.

05:01.650 --> 05:02.910
You need to have permission

05:02.910 --> 05:04.233
to capture the traffic.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.390
In my example, that's fine.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.540
This is my own local home network,

05:09.540 --> 05:13.350
but be careful capturing traffic

05:13.350 --> 05:15.780
on any network, especially a public network.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.220
You could get into trouble.

05:17.220 --> 05:20.340
So adhere to the laws of where you are.

05:20.340 --> 05:23.520
Ethical hacking means that you need to be careful.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.200
Don't just hack any network.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.450
Don't just access any network

05:27.450 --> 05:29.700
unless you really want to go to jail

05:29.700 --> 05:32.340
or you know, want to get a fine.

05:32.340 --> 05:35.520
Be careful, do things ethically.

05:35.520 --> 05:36.353
But there you go.

05:36.353 --> 05:37.186
Simple as that

05:37.186 --> 05:39.240
to download and install Wireshark

05:39.240 --> 05:40.560
on a Windows computer

05:40.560 --> 05:42.003
and then capture traffic.

05:43.050 --> 05:43.890
In subsequent videos,

05:43.890 --> 05:46.110
I'll show you more options in Wireshark,

05:46.110 --> 05:48.360
but I simply wanted to get you started

05:48.360 --> 05:50.433
downloading and installing Wireshark.
