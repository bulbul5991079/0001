This is one of multiple videos discussing IP subnetting.

1
00:13.500 --> 00:20.070
I've received a number of questions asking me to explain various subnetting scenarios and this is one

2
00:20.070 --> 00:21.310
of them.

3
00:21.340 --> 00:30.720
So can the PC on the left configure it with this IP address 10 .1.248.1 slash 20 ping the PC

4
00:30.720 --> 00:37.810
on the right with IP address 10.1.192.2 slash 20.

5
00:37.920 --> 00:46.440
In this example, I'm using Cisco routers as my PCs and I'm doing that because it's important that you

6
00:46.440 --> 00:50.000
learn the Cisco CLI. 

7
00:50.110 --> 00:56.680
However, the subnetting behavior will be the same on Cisco versus a PC but it gives us a lot of options

8
00:56.710 --> 01:00.950
to troubleshoot and test our subnetting scenarios.

9
01:01.300 --> 01:10.290
So this is the IP address configured on gigabit 00, show run interface gigabit 00 shows us the IP address

10
01:10.290 --> 01:19.670
configuration and show IP interface gigabit 00 shows us the IP address inside the notation.

11
01:19.670 --> 01:27.270
So that's the address inside a notation and that's the address configured in dotted decimal notation.

12
01:27.430 --> 01:34.520
I'll do the same here show run interface gigabit 00 there's the IP address of PC 2 or router 2 acting

13
01:34.520 --> 01:41.520
as PC 2 dotted decimal notation and show IP interface gigabit 00.

14
01:41.900 --> 01:47.660
And what I'll do is only include the IP address of 10.

15
01:47.930 --> 01:52.910
So there's the IP address inside the notation.

16
01:53.040 --> 02:03.350
I could do it this way which shows all the output but it's nice to have that output as well as this

17
02:03.350 --> 02:04.760
output on the same screen.

18
02:07.440 --> 02:16.580
I'll do the same here show run interface gigabit 00 show IP interface gigabit 00 and I'll include 10.

19
02:16.950 --> 02:23.130
So there's the IP address inside the notation and a dotted decimal notation.

20
02:23.130 --> 02:27.310
So the question again can these two PCs ping each other.

21
02:27.720 --> 02:28.780
So let's test it.

22
02:28.800 --> 02:31.950
Ping 10.1.248.1

23
02:31.980 --> 02:40.660
notice the pings are failing ping 10.1.192.2, pings are failing.

24
02:40.680 --> 02:43.620
Why are they failing?

25
02:43.620 --> 02:48.000
The answer is the PCs are in different subnets.

26
02:48.000 --> 02:53.130
They connected physically to each other and we can see that by using the command show CDP neighbors

27
02:53.790 --> 03:01.640
notice router1 is connected to router 2 on gigabit 00 and router 2 is connected back on gigabit

28
03:01.730 --> 03:02.870
00.

29
03:03.330 --> 03:08.670
So they're definitely connected to each other physically but they can't ping each other.

30
03:10.790 --> 03:17.320
To help explain, I've taken the IP addresses in decimal notation and converted them to binary.

31
03:17.570 --> 03:22.100
So this is the binary representation of 10.1.248.1 

32
03:22.370 --> 03:32.630
Here's the binary representation of 10.1.192.2 slash 20 means 20 binary ones in the subnet

33
03:32.630 --> 03:33.450
mask.

34
03:33.500 --> 03:37.040
Here's the subnet mask with 20 binary ones.

35
03:37.070 --> 03:44.810
I typically don't have a space between your binary bits but I've just added that to make it easier to

36
03:44.810 --> 03:45.830
read.

37
03:45.830 --> 03:50.380
So here's the first octet, second octet, third octet

38
03:50.660 --> 03:57.010
But notice four binary ones in the third octet and four binary zeros.

39
03:57.350 --> 03:58.840
The same is shown here

40
03:58.860 --> 04:00.240
slash 20.

41
04:00.290 --> 04:03.200
So are these two devices in the same subnet.

42
04:03.200 --> 04:04.800
The answer is, No

43
04:04.890 --> 04:10.710
Because notice the network portion is different on these two devices.

44
04:10.820 --> 04:18.180
I've highlighted the network portion in red, the host portion as shown in blue. For devices to be in

45
04:18.180 --> 04:25.980
the same subnet the network portion or subnet portion needs to be the same on both devices, notice here

46
04:26.100 --> 04:28.070
the subnet portion is different.

47
04:28.110 --> 04:34.530
So they are in different subnets and won't be able to ping each other unless you put a router between

48
04:34.530 --> 04:37.580
them or change the subnet mask.

49
04:38.010 --> 04:41.790
What would you change the subnet mask to, to allow them to ping each other?

50
04:46.050 --> 04:58.500
And the answer is make the subnet portion this which means that the host portion is now changed

51
05:00.190 --> 05:01.260
to that.

52
05:01.480 --> 05:04.090
So this is the host portion

53
05:04.260 --> 05:09.000
this is the network portion, network portion is now the same.

54
05:09.000 --> 05:20.290
That equates to 8 plus 8, 16 17 18 binary bits which equates to 255.255.192.

55
05:20.370 --> 05:30.010
So previously that was the IP address on this side and that was the IP address on the right-hand side.

56
05:30.080 --> 05:42.500
So we would change the IP address to 10.1.192.2, 255.255.192.0 and on this side interface

57
05:42.500 --> 05:51.500
gigabit00, IP address 10.1.248.1, 255.255.192.0.

58
05:51.920 --> 05:57.620
So same IP address all I've changed is the subnet mask.

59
05:57.620 --> 06:05.680
So can the router on the right acting as our PC ping the router on the left acting as a PC.

60
06:05.780 --> 06:07.970
And the answer is, Yes it can.

61
06:07.970 --> 06:14.910
It dropped the first ping while doing an ARP but notice device on the right can ping the device on the

62
06:14.910 --> 06:20.170
left and the device on the left can ping the device on the right.

63
06:20.400 --> 06:32.560
And that's just because we changed the subnet mask to slash 18 and put the devices in the same subnet.

64
06:32.560 --> 06:38.860
