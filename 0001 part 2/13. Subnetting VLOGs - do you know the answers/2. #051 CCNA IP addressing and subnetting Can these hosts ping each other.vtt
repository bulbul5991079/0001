This is one of multiple videos discussing IP subnetting.

1
00:13.440 --> 00:19.410
I've received numerous questions with regards to IP subnetting and I'm gonna try and answer a lot

2
00:19.410 --> 00:21.550
of them through these videos.

3
00:22.610 --> 00:24.260
So here's a question for you.

4
00:24.580 --> 00:26.810
Will PC 1 on the left

5
00:26.870 --> 00:33.860
be able to ping PC 2 on right in this typology, PC on the left is configured with an IP address of

6
00:33.860 --> 00:38.320
10.1.255.1 slash 17

7
00:38.690 --> 00:42.210
and the PC on the right is configured with an IP address of 10.1

8
00:42.250 --> 00:51.950
.28 .2 slash 17 in the apology I'm using Cisco routers instead of Windows PCs.

9
00:53.160 --> 00:59.320
As it's important for you to learn the Cisco CLI and it's important for you to learn commands available

10
00:59.500 --> 01:01.320
on Cisco devices.

11
01:01.310 --> 01:08.290
So show IP interface brief shows me the IP address configured on the gigabit 00 interface of this router

12
01:10.530 --> 01:19.790
show IP interface brief shows me the IP address configured on gigabit 00 of this router, show run interface

13
01:19.790 --> 01:29.180
gigabit 00 shows me the configuration of the IP address and we can see that over here as well and show

14
01:29.210 --> 01:38.810
IP interface gigabit 00 shows us the configuration of router 2 and same on the side, show IP interface

15
01:38.810 --> 01:47.420
gigabit 00 that's the IP address of router 1 acting as PC 1 here's the IP address of router 2 acting

16
01:47.420 --> 01:48.700
as PC 2.

17
01:49.010 --> 02:00.600
So will these two routers acting as PCs be able to ping each other so ping 10.1.255.1

18
02:01.220 --> 02:01.560
router 2

19
02:01.570 --> 02:09.220
is able to ping router 1 we can actually see that in real-time by using a de-bug IP ICMP command

20
02:09.910 --> 02:15.530
that de-bug allows us to see ICMP traffic in real time.

21
02:15.640 --> 02:23.520
ICMP is the protocol used by ping. In this example I'll send a single ping to router 1, ping succeeds

22
02:24.280 --> 02:34.390
and we can see that a echo reply was sent back to router 2 with a source IP address of 10.1.255.1 destination

23
02:34.420 --> 02:37.880
IP address of 10.1.128.2

24
02:38.350 --> 02:41.490
So how do we know that they were in the same subnet.

25
02:43.260 --> 02:50.470
Show run interface gigabit 00, show run interface gigabit 00.

26
02:50.640 --> 02:53.780
You need to look at network and host portions 

27
02:53.780 --> 02:57.830
255 means that the first octet is network,

28
02:58.000 --> 03:02.330
255 means that the second octet is network, here

29
03:02.340 --> 03:06.030
however we've got 128 in the network portion.

30
03:06.030 --> 03:10.910
So it becomes a little bit more tricky to work out host and network portions.

31
03:11.970 --> 03:14.800
So let's write that out

32
03:15.570 --> 03:18.960
together 10.1 is fairly simple

33
03:19.080 --> 03:20.820
that's a network portion.

34
03:21.200 --> 03:29.350
However, 128 in binary equals 1 followed by seven binary zeros.

35
03:29.520 --> 03:32.560
Just put a space here to make it easier to read

36
03:32.580 --> 03:35.040
obviously that space doesn't exist

37
03:35.820 --> 03:39.330
but I'll just do that for clarity of reading.

38
03:39.600 --> 03:41.690
So this is the IP address portion

39
03:42.030 --> 03:49.060
and this is the mask a binary one in the mask indicates that that portion is part of the network 

40
03:49.780 --> 03:54.250
zeroes in the mask indicates that this is host portion.

41
03:54.250 --> 04:01.900
So in this example, the network portion of the address equals 10.1 in decimal

42
04:02.080 --> 04:12.360
and then the first binary bit in the third octet if we look at this address here 10.1 is network

43
04:12.370 --> 04:17.970
portion based on that, that's the same as what we've got over here.

44
04:18.310 --> 04:26.600
But in the third octet we've got 255, 255 in binary is eight binary ones

45
04:26.650 --> 04:29.320
and again I'll put a space here just for clarity.

46
04:29.650 --> 04:32.640
The mask equals 128,

47
04:32.830 --> 04:44.990
so in this example, the network portion is the first bit which is the same as 128.

48
04:45.020 --> 04:52.190
So if you look at the address here, 10.1. first binary bit is network and the same is true

49
04:52.190 --> 04:52.760
here.

50
04:52.910 --> 04:57.110
10.1 one plus first binary bit in third octet is network.

51
04:57.380 --> 05:00.480
The rest of the address is the host portion.

52
05:00.680 --> 05:11.530
So I'll write it out fully 10.1.255.1 in binary equates to 0000 1010.

53
05:11.540 --> 05:23.020
That's 10 dot seven binary zeros and one binary one that's 1 dot eight binary 1

54
05:25.610 --> 05:34.430
followed by seven binary zeros and a binary one.

55
05:34.470 --> 05:40.560
So that is the address in binary of 10.1.255.1

56
05:40.680 --> 05:46.680
and if we look at the mask we've got 8 binary ones in the first octet.

57
05:46.680 --> 05:55.330
So the first octet is network, second octet is also network.

58
05:55.600 --> 06:05.280
But in the third octet, we have one binary one followed by seven binary zeros.

59
06:08.250 --> 06:11.240
So this portion is the network portion,

60
06:11.550 --> 06:14.000
this portion is the host portion.

61
06:17.980 --> 06:18.960
So blue is host,

62
06:23.980 --> 06:26.380
red is network portion.

63
06:26.380 --> 06:37.450
If we look at the other address used in the network which is 10.1.128.2

64
06:40.780 --> 06:46.810
the host portion is different but the network portion is the same.

65
06:46.810 --> 06:53.020
So these two devices even though they have different host portions are still in the same subnet

66
06:53.020 --> 06:55.280
based on that information there.

67
06:55.600 --> 06:58.180
So they are in the same subnet

68
07:01.280 --> 07:03.080
and hence the device on the right

69
07:03.080 --> 07:10.790
can ping the device on the left, ping succeed and we can see the debug output on the screen.

70
07:11.210 --> 07:18.010
