00:11.060 --> 00:19.280
This is one of multiple IP addressing and subnetting scenarios rather than just working out the subnets

1
00:19.370 --> 00:21.130
for a scenario.

2
00:21.230 --> 00:28.340
We're gonna work them out and then configure the devices so that we can practically design and configure

3
00:28.760 --> 00:30.520
a Cisco IP network.

4
00:30.710 --> 00:35.150
So we've successfully configured this subnet.

5
00:35.150 --> 00:40.830
Now we need to configure this subnet and this gets a little bit more interesting because it's 192

6
00:40.850 --> 00:44.620
168 1 64 slice 26.

7
00:45.200 --> 00:48.160
So we already know what the subnet address is.

8
00:48.200 --> 00:51.660
Now we need to work out what the first host address is. 

9
00:51.740 --> 00:55.040
So what is the first host for this network?

10
00:58.110 --> 00:59.940
Now to work out to the first host.

11
00:59.970 --> 01:06.680
You make the host portion zeros except for the last bit which is set to 1.

12
01:07.170 --> 01:14.960
But to work out the decimal value over here you need to look at the entire octet.

13
01:15.000 --> 01:21.770
So this is 64 because that's the network plus one is 65.

14
01:22.220 --> 01:24.600
So the first host is 65.

15
01:25.100 --> 01:27.230
What is the last host.

16
01:27.290 --> 01:34.890
The easiest way to work that out actually is to do broadcast first and then work out the last host.

17
01:34.920 --> 01:44.790
So for the broadcast what we do is we fill the host portion with binary ones.

18
01:44.900 --> 01:46.290
So what is that?

19
01:48.280 --> 01:55.460
It's 255 less 128 which is 127.

20
01:56.190 --> 02:01.360
So the broadcast address is 192 168 1 127.

21
02:01.410 --> 02:08.850
Now the last host is one less than the broadcast address.

22
02:08.970 --> 02:16.960
So for the last host, we set the host portion to binary ones except for the last bit.

23
02:17.210 --> 02:22.880
So what does that equal to, that's equal to 126.

24
02:22.890 --> 02:28.920
So let's assume that we configure the router with the last IP address in the subnet and then we're going

25
02:28.920 --> 02:35.360
to enable DCHP on the router to allocate IP addresses to the hosts.

26
02:35.450 --> 02:42.900
So here's router 2, on the fast ethernet interface I'm gonna no shut the interface and then I'm

27
02:42.900 --> 02:50.430
gonna configure an IP address as we worked out 192 168 1 126

28
02:50.610 --> 02:57.210
And then we need to specify the subnet mask 255 255 255 192, so can we ping 

29
03:00.660 --> 03:01.530
our local address?

30
03:01.530 --> 03:03.780
Yes, we can.

31
03:03.780 --> 03:07.740
Now for host allocation let's use DHCP.

32
03:08.220 --> 03:17.440
So we'll create a DHCP pool with a name, New York and here we need to specify the network.

33
03:17.460 --> 03:22.360
So what is the network? It's 192 168 1 64

34
03:22.890 --> 03:29.260
And here we have an option we can either use slash 26 or the dotted decimal notation.

35
03:29.760 --> 03:40.420
So let's use CIDR or slash 26, do show run will allow us to see our configuration.

36
03:40.420 --> 03:44.350
So that's what we've done in the DHCP pool.

37
03:44.370 --> 03:47.080
Now we need to configure a default gateway.

38
03:47.360 --> 03:52.740
So our default gateway is gonna be 192 168 1 126.

39
03:52.920 --> 03:59.190
There are other options that we can specify in DHCP such as DNS server.

40
03:59.820 --> 04:05.530
And in this case, let's set the DNS server to the local router in the real world you probably have a

41
04:05.530 --> 04:07.280
separate DNS server.

42
04:07.870 --> 04:08.590
So show run

43
04:11.890 --> 04:19.280
there's the DHCP pool that we've configured we've configured the default gateway or default router and

44
04:19.280 --> 04:24.800
DNS server, now in the hosts

45
04:24.900 --> 04:26.700
let's see if they get IP addresses.

46
04:29.520 --> 04:36.260
So on the hosts we're gonna configure them to use DHCP rather than static IP addresses.

47
04:36.750 --> 04:44.830
So let's do that on both hosts or both PCs.

48
04:45.050 --> 04:47.200
Change them to use DHCP.

49
04:47.660 --> 04:54.130
And then let's start them up and let's see if they get an IP address from the DHCP server.

50
04:55.160 --> 04:57.590
Open up a console to both of them.

51
04:57.680 --> 05:05.680
So here you can see the first host got an IP address 192 168 1 65.

52
05:05.860 --> 05:11.200
And the second host got an IP address of 192 168 1 66.

53
05:11.200 --> 05:13.750
So can the second host ping the first host?

54
05:13.810 --> 05:15.950
Yes, it can.

55
05:16.310 --> 05:20.520
Will it be able to ping the default gateway.

56
05:20.560 --> 05:22.060
Let's try that.

57
05:22.720 --> 05:24.040
Yes, it can.

58
05:24.700 --> 05:32.410
So we've successfully configured the New York site with an IP address on the default gateway and we've

59
05:32.410 --> 05:34.530
set up a DHCP.

60
05:34.540 --> 05:41.390
Now one thing you wanna do when you set up a DHCP pool like this is specify the excluded address.

61
05:41.560 --> 05:49.130
We don't want the DHCP server to allocate its own address so we can use the command IP DHCP server

62
05:52.310 --> 05:55.990
or rather IP DHCP excluded address.

63
05:56.510 --> 06:04.910
And we can specify a range of addresses to exclude and this example will only exclude the local routers

64
06:04.970 --> 06:12.810
IP address so we excluded the local routers IP address which means that it won't be allocated through

65
06:12.810 --> 06:14.580
DHCP.

66
06:14.940 --> 06:20.520
I'll save the routers configuration and while we're here let's save router 1s configuration.

67
06:23.080 --> 06:27.300
OK, so at this point we've configured both San Francisco and New York.

68
06:27.430 --> 06:31.050
The next step is to configure the WAN connection.

69
06:31.060 --> 06:38.950
Now it's inefficient to use a subnet that supports 62 hosts for a network that only requires two.

70
06:39.640 --> 06:44.910
But for now, let's start off by using the subnet that we allocated.

71
06:45.460 --> 06:51.500
And then in a subsequent video, I'll show you how to optimize this, so on router 1

72
06:51.750 --> 06:57.120
let's allocate the first IP address in the subnet to the router.

73
06:57.400 --> 07:02.670
So that's essentially one more than the subnet address.

74
07:02.830 --> 07:07.990
So 129 and one more than that

75
07:10.430 --> 07:11.410
would be 130

76
07:14.870 --> 07:25.250
with our subnet mask so what you'll notice is the first IP address is one more than the subnet address and

77
07:25.250 --> 07:33.750
the last IP address is one less than the broadcast address so we need to no shut these two interfaces

78
07:34.560 --> 07:42.340
and what should happen now is router 1 should be able to ping router 2 which it can.

79
07:42.820 --> 07:50.330
So we've successfully configured the IP addresses on the WAN and on both LAN interfaces but to enable

80
07:50.330 --> 07:54.480
full connectivity in this network we need to run a routing protocol.

81
07:54.980 --> 08:04.850
And in this example, I'll run EIGRP and enable the EIGRP on network 192 168 1.0

82
08:04.910 --> 08:08.780
Now that is a class full network.

83
08:08.780 --> 08:17.720
In other words, it's looking at class C 192 168 1.0 and not to the subnet addresses on the side

84
08:17.720 --> 08:19.560
we'll do something similar.

85
08:19.650 --> 08:22.530
Network 192 168 1.0, I'll

86
08:22.610 --> 08:30.740
disable automatic summarization so that they don't automatically summarize any network's show IP EI

87
08:30.760 --> 08:36.630
GRP neighbor, notice a neighbor relationship is established to router 2

88
08:37.070 --> 08:38.780
and we should see something similar here.

89
08:38.780 --> 08:45.980
Show IP EIGRP neighbor, neighbor relationship is established to router 1 show IP route.

90
08:46.460 --> 08:54.130
Notice router 1 has 192 168 1.0 directly connected on fast

91
08:54.140 --> 09:02.950
ethernet 00 and 192 168 1 128 directly connected to serial to slash 0.

92
09:02.960 --> 09:04.700
Those are the two subnets.

93
09:04.700 --> 09:14.700
It's also learnt about network 192 168 1 64 from 192 168 1 130.

94
09:14.700 --> 09:22.100
In other words router 2, in the same way router 2 has 192 168 1 64 directly connected to fast

95
09:22.110 --> 09:30.720
Ethernet 0 slash 0 and 192 168 1 128 is directly connected to serial 2 slash 0.

96
09:30.920 --> 09:37.280
This router has learnt about a network through EIGRP from 192 168 1 129.

97
09:37.280 --> 09:44.570
In other words router 1 and it's learnt about network 192 168 1.0 so router 1 at this point should be able

98
09:44.570 --> 09:51.580
to ping PC 3 and PC 4, and the ping succeed.

99
09:52.650 --> 09:59.380
Now, if you remember PC 3 was allocated this IP address and we can confirm that by using the command

100
09:59.510 --> 10:06.470
IF config Ethernet0 is the IP address of PC 3, PC 4 IF config

101
10:06.510 --> 10:07.880
Eth 0

102
10:07.950 --> 10:20.360
There's the IP address of PC 4, so router 1 is able to ping both the PCs, now can PC one ping those

103
10:20.410 --> 10:25.450
PCs. So can we ping 192 168 1 65?

104
10:25.660 --> 10:26.900
Yes, we can.

105
10:27.130 --> 10:29.180
And 66? Yes, we can.

106
10:29.500 --> 10:35.010
Let's trace to 192 168 1 65.

107
10:35.070 --> 10:38.600
Notice the trace goes to 192 168 1

108
10:38.680 --> 10:42.660
62, router 1.

109
10:42.750 --> 10:51.090
Then it goes to 192 168 1 130 which is router 2 on the serial subnet and then it goes to 192 16

110
10:51.090 --> 10:55.570
8 165, which is PC 3.

111
10:55.590 --> 10:56.110
Be careful.

112
10:56.130 --> 10:59.220
These are separate subnets.

113
10:59.220 --> 11:04.660
These hosts are in different subnets, so that was an example of subnetting.

114
11:04.890 --> 11:11.680
We took a network, we created subnets, we worked out the subnet address, first host address, last host

115
11:11.680 --> 11:17.910
address and broadcast the address and we configured the network accordingly and then we tested that

116
11:17.910 --> 11:19.290
it worked.

117
11:19.290 --> 11:24.240
That was a simple example of a practical implementation of subnetting but it's really important that

118
11:24.240 --> 11:26.200
you know how to subnet.

119
11:26.210 --> 11:27.520
