00:10.950 --> 00:19.170
This is one of multiple IP addressing and subnetting scenarios rather than just working out the subnets

1
00:19.290 --> 00:20.960
for a scenario.

2
00:21.100 --> 00:28.230
We're gonna work them out and then configure the devices so that we can practically design and configure

3
00:28.650 --> 00:32.120
a Cisco IP network. In this scenario

4
00:32.120 --> 00:36.870
let's assume that we've got two sites one in San Francisco one in New York.

5
00:36.870 --> 00:40.770
The sites are connected via a serial link.

6
00:40.860 --> 00:46.670
In this scenario, we've been allocated a subnet of 192 168 1.0 slash 24.

7
00:46.980 --> 00:52.210
And we need to subnet this network to support this topology.

8
00:52.240 --> 00:54.880
Let's assume that this is a small medium business.

9
00:54.910 --> 00:59.530
So, all PCs at each site will be in the same subnet.

10
00:59.530 --> 01:05.980
We're going to keep it simple by configuring the hosts in a single subnet at each site but there are

11
01:05.980 --> 01:10.870
60 hosts in San Francisco and 60 hosts in New York.

12
01:10.880 --> 01:22.730
OK, so this is our subnet 192 168 1.0 slash24, now slash 24 means that there are 24 binary ones

13
01:22.730 --> 01:25.910
in the subnet mask. In the first octet

14
01:25.920 --> 01:28.020
we have eight binary ones.

15
01:28.350 --> 01:33.290
Second octet to 8 binary ones a third octet a binary ones.

16
01:33.330 --> 01:37.100
Now in an octet there is no space between the binary ones.

17
01:37.110 --> 01:45.570
I'm just going to represent them that way to make it easier to read 24 is a side notation or classless

18
01:45.570 --> 01:47.600
into domain writing notation.

19
01:47.820 --> 01:54.010
Twenty four means that the subnet mask again consists of 24 binary ones.

20
01:54.090 --> 01:57.640
Again there is no space between the binary ones.

21
01:57.990 --> 01:59.660
But to make it easier to read.

22
01:59.850 --> 02:01.550
I'm going to show it with spaces.

23
02:01.560 --> 02:10.650
So he has octet 1 8 binary ones equates to 255 and decimal 8 binary ones equates to 255 8 binary ones

24
02:10.650 --> 02:17.160
equates to 255 8 to binary zeros equates to 0 using decimal.

25
02:17.160 --> 02:22.110
So this is the dotted decimal notation of the subnet mask.

26
02:22.140 --> 02:27.540
This is the Sajda notational binary notation.

27
02:27.580 --> 02:31.520
Now when working with binary Don't forget the following.

28
02:31.750 --> 02:39.670
If you have a 1 in the least significant but in the octet that represents 1 in decimal 1 in the second

29
02:39.730 --> 02:48.070
least significant position in binary equates to 2 in decimal that equates to 4 and so forth and so 1

30
02:48.220 --> 02:54.870
1 in the most significant position in the octet equates to 128.

31
02:54.900 --> 03:00.700
So if we look at 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 0 in binary 1 9 2 is that.

32
03:00.870 --> 03:06.270
In other words it's 128 plus 64 168 in decimal.

33
03:06.270 --> 03:08.330
Looks like this in binary.

34
03:08.340 --> 03:15.820
In other words it's 128 plus 32 plus 8 1 in decimal.

35
03:15.830 --> 03:17.690
Looks like this in binary.

36
03:17.690 --> 03:23.220
In other words only the last bit is set on 0 in decimal

37
03:23.220 --> 03:24.870
looks as follows.

38
03:24.870 --> 03:27.250
This is what our subnet mask looks like

39
03:28.420 --> 03:34.280
255 255 255 is zero.

40
03:34.900 --> 03:39.240
So in other words this portion is the network portion.

41
03:39.490 --> 03:46.180
This portion is the host portion a subnet mask indicates which portion is network and which portion

42
03:46.180 --> 03:47.430
is host.

43
03:47.440 --> 03:53.760
So this means that the first octet is network, second octet is network, third octet is network, fourth

44
03:53.770 --> 03:55.280
octet is host.

45
03:55.740 --> 04:03.330
So 192.168.1.0 slash 24 means that this is network, this is host.

46
04:03.340 --> 04:06.140
OK so we've been allocated this network.

47
04:06.220 --> 04:09.030
How do we subnet this.

48
04:09.090 --> 04:14.190
You need to decide whether you're gonna use host or network to do your subnetting.

49
04:14.190 --> 04:16.310
In this example we're gonna look at hosts.

50
04:16.560 --> 04:23.700
We've got a requirement for 60 hosts on two subnets, when you want to work out the number of bits required

51
04:23.700 --> 04:26.580
to support a certain number of hosts.

52
04:26.580 --> 04:33.970
Use the formula 2 to the power of x where x is the number of bits that is required for hosts minus 2.

53
04:34.680 --> 04:41.640
If you want to work out the number of networks you use the formula 2 to the power of x where x is the

54
04:41.640 --> 04:45.240
number of bits that you're gonna be using for networks.

55
04:46.790 --> 04:53.680
The reason why we have to subtract two here is we need to we, need to allocate two addresses for special

56
04:53.680 --> 04:54.860
use cases.

57
04:54.970 --> 05:01.750
One is network or subnet and one is the broadcast address so hence we need to subtract two.

58
05:02.500 --> 05:07.960
So if we're gonna support 60 hosts. That's what we've got in our topology here.

59
05:08.020 --> 05:13.240
We've got two subnets consisting of 60 hosts how many bits do we need.

60
05:13.490 --> 05:14.860
So to work this out.

61
05:15.730 --> 05:18.200
Work out how many binary bits you need.

62
05:18.490 --> 05:24.920
So two to the power of two as an example minus two gives you two.

63
05:24.960 --> 05:34.610
So if you use two binary bits per our formula that'll only support two hosts, OK so how many bits are required

64
05:34.610 --> 05:36.680
to support 60 hosts.

65
05:36.680 --> 05:38.260
The answer is 6 bits.

66
05:38.450 --> 05:45.930
And that's because two to the power of six equals 64 minus two it gives you 62.

67
05:46.100 --> 05:53.690
So we will have enough hosts to support 60 hosts if we use six bits. 

68
05:53.800 --> 06:00.960
So 60 hosts will require six bits for the host portion of the address.

69
06:00.980 --> 06:09.740
Now currently 192 168 1.0 slash 24 means we have 8 bits in the host portion.

70
06:09.830 --> 06:21.200
So if we need six bits in the host portion that means that two bits can be stolen if you like for subnets.

71
06:21.230 --> 06:31.220
So think of subnets as stolen bits, we're gonna steal two bits from the host portion to create additional

72
06:31.220 --> 06:32.800
subnets.

73
06:32.920 --> 06:39.540
That means that our subnet mask changes to slash 26.

74
06:39.550 --> 06:45.700
The reason why it's slash 26 is we have eight bits in the first octet for network, plus 8 bits in the second

75
06:45.700 --> 06:50.320
octet, Plus 8 bits in a third octet that gives us 24.

76
06:50.500 --> 06:57.760
But we also have an additional 2 bits in the fourth octet which gives us 26.

77
06:57.760 --> 07:11.630
So a subnet mask in dotted-decimal notation will be 255 255 255 192 it's 192 because 128 plus

78
07:11.630 --> 07:18.930
64 gives you 192 so this is our new subnet mask.

79
07:19.430 --> 07:23.460
So how do we work out the different subnets.

80
07:23.500 --> 07:35.070
The first subnet will be exactly this 192.168.1.0 slash 26 now to work out the next subnet look at

81
07:35.070 --> 07:36.720
your subnet portion.

82
07:36.720 --> 07:39.580
So what I'll do is I'll change this to another color

83
07:42.660 --> 07:44.030
lets say orange.

84
07:44.220 --> 07:48.300
So the orange portion or subnet portion needs to change.

85
07:48.300 --> 07:52.070
This is network, this is subnet.

86
07:52.200 --> 08:01.480
This is host portion, so to work out the next subnet you cycle through all the variations of binary

87
08:01.570 --> 08:04.350
for the number of bits that you've got.

88
08:04.360 --> 08:13.450
So think about this as two cables, you've got two cables and you can put electricity on one cable or two

89
08:13.450 --> 08:15.400
cables or no cables.

90
08:15.820 --> 08:19.780
So this means there's no electricity on either cable.

91
08:19.780 --> 08:25.710
This means that you're putting electricity on the second cable but not the first cable.

92
08:25.720 --> 08:30.220
This means that you're putting electricity on the first cable but not the second cable.

93
08:30.220 --> 08:34.340
And this means that you're putting electricity on both cables.

94
08:34.390 --> 08:38.310
So this is no electricity on both cables.

95
08:38.310 --> 08:39.330
This is electricity

96
08:39.340 --> 08:46.760
on the second cable this is electricity on the first cable.

97
08:46.990 --> 08:50.640
and this is electricity on both cables.

98
08:50.680 --> 08:56.500
So what does that equate to this means zero in decimal.

99
08:56.520 --> 09:08.710
This however looking at the entire octet isn't 0, 0.1 in binary means that the second bit is set on.

100
09:08.720 --> 09:11.930
So what that means is that this is 64.

101
09:12.260 --> 09:15.020
What does this whole octet equate to?

102
09:15.200 --> 09:18.240
That's 128 first binary

103
09:18.250 --> 09:20.770
bit in octet is on. 

104
09:20.870 --> 09:22.370
What does this equate to?

105
09:22.400 --> 09:24.540
This is 192.

106
09:25.070 --> 09:29.210
So what we've got now are four subnets.

107
09:29.210 --> 09:40.350
192.168.1.0 slash 26, 192 168 1 64 slash 26, 128 and 192.

108
09:40.360 --> 09:48.710
So what we can do now is allocate the first subnet to the hosts on the left and then as an example we

109
09:48.710 --> 09:56.110
could allocate the second subnet to the hosts on the right.

110
09:56.290 --> 10:06.520
And then what we could do is allocate the third subnet for the serial link and that means we've got

111
10:06.520 --> 10:09.980
one additional subnet for future use.

112
10:10.000 --> 10:15.490
Now we can optimize the subnet and I'll show you how to do that later but for now we'll allocate a slash

113
10:15.490 --> 10:19.270
26 subnet to the serial link.

114
10:19.270 --> 10:20.770
Generally you don't want to do that.

115
10:20.770 --> 10:27.580
You wanna allocate a slash 30 which means that you only have two IP addresses in a subnet and you

116
10:27.580 --> 10:30.220
do that to conserve IP addresses.

117
10:30.220 --> 10:36.760
But for now let's configure the network using slash 26 and then I'll show you later how to subnet this

118
10:36.850 --> 10:38.070
further.

119
10:38.070 --> 10:41.500
