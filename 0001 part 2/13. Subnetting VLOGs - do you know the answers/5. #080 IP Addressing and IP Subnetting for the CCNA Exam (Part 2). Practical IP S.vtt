00:11.050 --> 00:19.300
This is one of multiple IP addressing and subnetting scenarios rather than just working out the subnets

1
00:19.360 --> 00:20.880
for a scenario.

2
00:21.220 --> 00:28.330
We gonna work them out and then configure the devices so that we can practically design and configure

3
00:28.750 --> 00:30.480
a Cisco IP network.

4
00:31.400 --> 00:37.400
OK so now that we've worked out the subnets we need to configure the devices in our network.

5
00:37.430 --> 00:45.760
Let's assume that these switches are Layer 2 switches the local area networks need to support up to

6
00:45.760 --> 00:52.580
60 hosts including an IP address allocated to the switches and the routers.

7
00:52.900 --> 00:59.590
So let's start with router 1 on the fastEthernet interface.

8
01:00.010 --> 01:02.910
I'm gonna no shut the interface.

9
01:03.400 --> 01:11.170
We need to configure an IP address so 192 168 1 and this is why subnetting is so important.

10
01:11.520 --> 01:14.530
What address are we gonna allocate to the router?

11
01:14.530 --> 01:20.920
So the network we're using is 192 186 1.0 slash 26.

12
01:21.000 --> 01:24.910
So let's assume we want to use the last IP address for the router.

13
01:26.080 --> 01:32.500
What is the first IP address and last IP address in the subnet?

14
01:32.720 --> 01:37.440
So there are four addresses that we need to think about, we need to think about the subnet address that's

15
01:37.450 --> 01:41.690
192 168 1.0 slash 26.

16
01:41.720 --> 01:45.380
Then we need to work out the first IP address

17
01:45.550 --> 01:52.610
or first host that can be allocated then we need to work out the last IP address and we need to work

18
01:52.610 --> 01:55.530
out what the broadcast address is.

19
01:55.540 --> 02:04.780
So we already have the subnet address, to work out the first IP address what you do is you set all binary

20
02:05.230 --> 02:10.760
bits to 0 in the host portion except for the last bit.

21
02:10.800 --> 02:16.640
So if you look at this that equates to 1 in decimal.

22
02:16.700 --> 02:22.220
So the first host will be 192 168 1.1 slash 26.

23
02:25.040 --> 02:26.660
There's our subnet.

24
02:26.720 --> 02:36.700
There's our first host, to work out to the last address in the subnet you fill the host portion only the host

25
02:36.700 --> 02:39.440
portion with binary ones.

26
02:39.640 --> 02:46.740
Except for the last bit which is set to binary 0.

27
02:47.190 --> 02:54.010
So notice the host portion is filled with binary ones except for the last bit.

28
02:54.200 --> 02:55.400
So what does this equal.

29
02:55.430 --> 03:08.140
It's 32 plus 16 which is 48 plus 8 which is 56 plus 4 which is 60 plus 2 which is 62.

30
03:08.950 --> 03:14.900
So that equals 62 slash 26.

31
03:15.060 --> 03:17.600
And what is the broadcast address equal to.

32
03:18.150 --> 03:23.910
Now talk about easier ways to work this out but let's work it out as follows.

33
03:23.910 --> 03:30.600
So to work out the broadcast what you do is you fill the host portion with binary ones and that will

34
03:30.600 --> 03:39.090
give you 63 slash 26 so you can either count up all these bits or you do it in reverse.

35
03:39.090 --> 03:43.580
You say it's 255 minus 128 minus 64.

36
03:43.580 --> 03:47.010
This is why it's good to have this in the exam.

37
03:47.010 --> 03:53.420
So when you go to the exam write this down so that you can work out the values.

38
03:53.460 --> 03:58.330
So this address is a broadcast address so we can't allocate that to the router.

39
03:58.470 --> 04:02.780
But what we can do is allocate the last IP address to the router.

40
04:02.930 --> 04:13.290
So the routing needs to be configured as 192 168 1 62 and the mask is 255 255 255 192.

41
04:13.430 --> 04:29.150
Remember the mask is 255 255 255 192, IP address again is 192 168 162 which is what we've configured

42
04:29.150 --> 04:29.870
on the router.

43
04:29.960 --> 04:31.620
So I can press enter.

44
04:32.240 --> 04:41.430
So we've now configured the router and as an example, we should be able to ping ourselves which we

45
04:41.430 --> 04:46.940
can and if we ping 63 that is actually a broadcast

46
04:49.550 --> 04:53.130
so show IP interface fast

47
04:53.140 --> 05:03.730
ethernet 0 slash 0 notice the router is configured as follows IP address is 192 168 162 slash 26.

48
05:03.730 --> 05:11.840
This is all hosts, all network broadcast but this is a local subnet broadcast.

49
05:11.860 --> 05:18.430
So again show run interface f0 slash, f0 slash zero, there is our configuration.

50
05:18.460 --> 05:20.320
Now we need to configure the hosts

51
05:25.460 --> 05:34.620
and let's assume that we're gonna configure the first host using the first IP address in the subnet.

52
05:34.620 --> 05:36.930
So it's 192 168 1

53
05:40.610 --> 05:46.280
so it needs to be configured as 192 168 1.1 slash 26.

54
05:46.380 --> 05:59.640
So 1.1 subnet mask is 255 255 255 192, default gateway is 62 and I'll set the DNS to the

55
05:59.640 --> 06:10.220
default gateway, click save let's start-up that host and open up a console to the host.

56
06:10.250 --> 06:11.290
So here it is.

57
06:11.290 --> 06:18.170
I have config eth zero, IP address of the host is configured as follows.

58
06:19.980 --> 06:21.790
Mask is set to the following.

59
06:21.790 --> 06:27.390
So ping 192 168 1.1 and ping itself can we ping the router.

60
06:27.510 --> 06:29.100
Yes, we can.

61
06:29.100 --> 06:35.380
Now, to prove that we could de-bug IP ICMP and ping from the host to the router.

62
06:35.670 --> 06:40.860
You can see the pings are succeeding and we're getting it debug on the router.

63
06:40.890 --> 06:41.990
Turn off the Debug.

64
06:42.180 --> 06:52.160
Ping 192 168 1 21 router and ping the first PC show IP interface brief again.

65
06:52.370 --> 06:54.140
This is the IP address of the router.

66
06:54.260 --> 06:57.440
Let's configure the second PC 61

67
07:00.350 --> 07:03.880
so I'll configure that statically

68
07:10.100 --> 07:22.410
61 subnet mask is 255 255 255 192, router is 62 we'll set the DNS to the router

69
07:26.340 --> 07:30.850
and start the PC up and open up a console.

70
07:30.910 --> 07:42.940
So here's ubuntu 2, PC 2 I-F config ethe zero, IP address is 61 subnet mask is this, Can we ping

71
07:43.710 --> 07:45.100
the router?

72
07:45.730 --> 07:46.510
Yes, we can.

73
07:46.510 --> 07:47.790
Can we ping the other host?

74
07:47.790 --> 07:49.580
Yes, we can.

75
07:49.610 --> 07:53.900
So we've configured the IP addresses on this subnet.

76
07:53.930 --> 07:54.870
Now one last test.

77
07:54.890 --> 07:57.810
Let's ping the broadcast address.

78
07:57.830 --> 08:05.500
Notice the option we are told that we have to explicitly specify broadcast and when I broadcast the

79
08:05.500 --> 08:10.220
router actually replies to that broadcast the other host doesn't.

80
08:10.480 --> 08:20.320
But we are pinging the broadcast address when we use 63 so the broadcast isn't 192 168  1 255 the

81
08:20.330 --> 08:24.990
broadcast address for the subnet is 192 168 1 63.

82
08:25.010 --> 08:29.450
So we have successfully configured this subnet.

83
08:29.450 --> 08:35.330
Now we need to configure this subnet and this gets a little bit more interesting because it's 192 1

84
08:35.330 --> 08:39.110
68 1 64 slash 26

85
08:39.110 --> 08:40.990
