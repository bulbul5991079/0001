00:11.140 --> 00:19.360
This is one of multiple IP addressing and subnetting scenarios rather than just working out the subnets

1
00:19.450 --> 00:21.290
for a scenario.

2
00:21.310 --> 00:28.390
We're gonna work them out and then configure the devices so that we can practically design and configure

3
00:28.810 --> 00:34.590
a Cisco IP network. In the previous video, we configured those GNS3 network

4
00:34.780 --> 00:39.720
and we proved that devices can ping one another, as an example.

5
00:40.760 --> 00:47.280
Ubuntu 1 or PC 1 can ping both Ubuntu 3 and Ubuntu 4.

6
00:47.720 --> 00:52.340
In other words, this host can ping these hosts on the right-hand side.

7
00:52.370 --> 00:59.210
Now, one of the things that we did was we configured the serial link with this subnet 192 168

8
00:59.210 --> 01:01.870
1 128 slash 26.

9
01:01.970 --> 01:09.530
Now that subnet can support 62 hosts that's a waste of IP addresses when in actual fact a serial link

10
01:09.590 --> 01:12.830
only requires two IP addresses.

11
01:12.830 --> 01:20.960
So we allocated this full subnet to the serial link the host portion currently contains six bits

12
01:21.890 --> 01:29.630
to the power of 6 minus 2 gives you the option to configure 62 host addresses but we only require

13
01:29.660 --> 01:30.350
two.

14
01:30.470 --> 01:41.000
So actually all we need are two bits in the host portion which will give us the option of having two

15
01:41.000 --> 01:44.030
host addresses in a subnet.

16
01:44.030 --> 01:50.060
Again, there are two formulas for network you use the formula 2 to the power of x, where x is the number

17
01:50.060 --> 01:55.220
of bits for host you use 2 to the power of x minus 2.

18
01:55.300 --> 01:58.380
2 is the number of bits in the host portion.

19
01:58.640 --> 02:05.220
We have to subtract two because we need a network address and a broadcast address in IP version 4.

20
02:05.750 --> 02:12.480
So 2 to the power of 2 minus 2 gives us 4 minus 2 which equals 2.

21
02:13.370 --> 02:23.050
So taking this subnet which we've currently got configured on the serial link lets subnet it further.

22
02:23.120 --> 02:31.730
So as an example on router 1 currently, show IP interface serial 2 slash zero.

23
02:32.120 --> 02:40.990
Shows us that 192 168 1 129 slash 26 is configured on the serial interface and that's because

24
02:42.270 --> 02:46.680
we configured this address on the serial interface.

25
02:46.680 --> 02:50.120
Now let's change that and optimize the subnet.

26
02:50.430 --> 03:00.910
So we only need two bits for the host portion so we can extend the subnet portion as follows.

27
03:02.060 --> 03:07.420
Now we are taking a already configured subnet and we're subnetting it again.

28
03:07.580 --> 03:14.230
So I'm gonna denote this portion as the network portion because that's what we were given.

29
03:14.300 --> 03:20.810
This is the new subnet portion and this is the new host portion.

30
03:20.970 --> 03:24.690
So that's what we had originally.

31
03:24.780 --> 03:27.660
We've now changed it to slash 30.

32
03:28.200 --> 03:32.040
So this would be then new first subnet

33
03:35.100 --> 03:44.400
the second subnet would not be 128 we'd have to cycle through the binary options so we'd make this a

34
03:44.410 --> 03:47.330
one which in decimal is four.

35
03:47.580 --> 03:50.190
So 128 plus four

36
03:50.560 --> 03:54.690
And let me update the subnet mask portion while we're here.

37
03:55.030 --> 03:59.690
So that's the new subnet mask.

38
03:59.780 --> 04:05.570
So this would be 128 plus 4 which is 132.

39
04:05.600 --> 04:09.380
So that would be the second Subnet.

40
04:09.440 --> 04:17.290
Now you might notice a trend here the difference between 128 and 132 is 4.

41
04:17.330 --> 04:26.810
So the third subnet would be 132 plus 4 which would be 136 if you wanted to work out the binary you

42
04:26.810 --> 04:35.550
would cycle through the various options so current on this wire no current on this wire.

43
04:35.760 --> 04:42.630
That's an 8 in decimal, so 128 Plus 8 in decimal is 136.

44
04:42.660 --> 04:49.020
So if I were you I'd only work out say the first two or three subnets and then just see the pattern.

45
04:49.170 --> 04:51.190
These are incrementing in fours.

46
04:51.240 --> 04:53.820
So the next one would be 140.

47
04:53.820 --> 05:00.470
So just look at the pattern and it'll be a lot easier to work out the next subnet.

48
05:00.470 --> 05:05.160
Now some other tricks that you can use if this is the next subnet.

49
05:06.090 --> 05:13.700
Then the first subnet broadcast address is one less than the next subnet.

50
05:13.910 --> 05:16.340
The next subnet is 132.

51
05:16.340 --> 05:20.140
So this subnets broadcast address is 131

52
05:23.980 --> 05:32.440
again to work out the broadcast address you fill the host portions with one,s so this is 128 plus

53
05:32.500 --> 05:39.900
two plus one or it's one less than the next subnet.

54
05:39.940 --> 05:45.310
So that's the new first subnet broadcast address.

55
05:45.460 --> 05:53.050
So the first host address is one more than the subnet address so it'll be 192

56
05:55.910 --> 06:07.070
in binary it looks like that the new first subnet last host is one less than the broadcast address so

57
06:07.070 --> 06:10.410
the broadcast address is 131.

58
06:10.490 --> 06:15.810
So this will be 130 in binary you fill

59
06:15.940 --> 06:22.940
the host portion with binary ones except for the last bit, here we've only got two bits.

60
06:23.000 --> 06:25.580
This is on and this is off.

61
06:25.640 --> 06:30.380
So that gives you the last host in the subnet.

62
06:30.450 --> 06:38.700
So that's an example of taking a subnet that we've created from a previous subnet and subnetting it

63
06:38.700 --> 06:42.380
again to get new subnets in the network.

64
06:43.340 --> 06:52.820
So currently on our network we are using a 26 here what we'll do you change that to slash 30 with the

65
06:52.820 --> 06:56.760
first host being 192 168 1 29 slash 30.

66
06:56.840 --> 07:03.520
And the second host being 192 168 1 130 slash 30.

67
07:03.640 --> 07:13.470
So that's the IP address on the first host or first router.

68
07:13.630 --> 07:22.060
This is the IP address on the second router we're gonna stay with 129 and 130 but we're gonna

69
07:22.060 --> 07:29.680
change the subnet mask its interface serial 2 slash 0 IP address 192 168 1 129

70
07:32.020 --> 07:46.340
and this now needs to be mask is a slash 30 because it's 8 plus 8 plus 8 plus 6 so slash 30

71
07:46.350 --> 07:46.920
mask.

72
07:49.560 --> 07:57.470
So this needs to change to 192 168 1 128 slash 30 that's the mask you'll often find on several

73
07:57.470 --> 08:02.280
links because it supports two host addresses.

74
08:02.290 --> 08:09.560
So again this is a slash 30 mask because we've got 30 binary ones in the subnet mask.

75
08:09.580 --> 08:18.990
So this is 255.255.255.252

76
08:19.200 --> 08:24.150
So this is gonna be 252 as the IP address.

77
08:24.360 --> 08:32.430
Notice the relationship goes down has come up again but we will probably have problems running it that

78
08:32.490 --> 08:33.100
way.

79
08:34.580 --> 08:38.000
So this side also needs to be 252.

80
08:38.030 --> 08:48.780
In other words, a slash 30 relationship has come up show IP interface serial 2 slash 0.

81
08:48.950 --> 08:58.350
Notice the mask now used is a slash 30 and on this side  show IP interface serial 2 slash 0.

82
08:58.520 --> 09:05.660
Notice the mask used is a slash 30, So can router 1 ping router 2?

83
09:05.980 --> 09:06.780
Yes, it can

84
09:10.430 --> 09:16.880
Can PC 1 still ping PC 3? Yes, It can and can it ping 

85
09:19.700 --> 09:22.790
PC 4? Yes, it can.

86
09:22.790 --> 09:31.040
So let's trace to 192 168 1 65.

87
09:31.100 --> 09:35.500
You can see it goes to router 1, router 2

88
09:35.930 --> 09:45.740
and then the remote PC so we've successfully updated the subnets in this topology to only use two IP

89
09:45.740 --> 09:48.590
addresses on the serial link.

90
09:48.590 --> 09:56.160
The reason for doing that is we can increase the number of subnets that we have.

91
09:56.170 --> 10:04.620
So rather than only having one subnet we've now increased the number of subnets to 2 to the power

92
10:04.620 --> 10:05.340
of 4.

93
10:05.540 --> 10:14.770
So we've actually got 16 separate subnets that we can use each of which support 2 host addresses.

94
10:14.790 --> 10:16.240
