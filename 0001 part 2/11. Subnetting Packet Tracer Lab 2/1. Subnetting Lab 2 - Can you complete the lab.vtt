This packet tracer lab is a continuation of a previous Packet Tracer lab. In the previous lab, you were

1
00:12.600 --> 00:22.900
asked to subnet 192 168 1.0 slash 24 and break it up into subnets for site 1 and site 2

2
00:23.250 --> 00:30.880
and you were asked to configure subnets on those sites as well as on the serial links. In this lab you

3
00:30.880 --> 00:38.370
need to subnet the network again to extend and conserve IP addresses an additional site has been added

4
00:38.460 --> 00:39.730
to the lab site 3.

5
00:39.730 --> 00:51.390
What you need to do is take the subnet 192 168 1 64 slash 26 and subnet that to support this third

6
00:51.390 --> 00:58.810
site as well as to reuse the subnet for the three serial connections.

7
00:59.160 --> 01:06.970
Serial links only need a slash 30 mask so you need to subnet the last new subnet that you get from

8
01:06.970 --> 01:17.050
192 168 1 64 slash 26 and you slash 30 masks so that you can allocate that subnet to the 3 serial

9
01:17.050 --> 01:18.700
links.

10
01:18.850 --> 01:26.920
So what you need to do once again is break up 192 168 1 64 slash 26 to support as many subnets as

11
01:26.920 --> 01:35.380
possible with 8 hosts per subnet to allocate the first new subnet to site 3.

12
01:35.500 --> 01:45.100
So in the words on the local area network over here and then take the last new subnet that you get

13
01:45.100 --> 01:54.370
from 192 168 1 64 and subnet that with slash 30 masks and then allocate those subnets to the serial

14
01:54.370 --> 02:01.450
links you need to configure the routers appropriately so this router needs to use the first IP address

15
02:01.960 --> 02:03.040
in the new subnet.

16
02:03.040 --> 02:12.790
This router the last one and the same is true for the other sites, on the local area network at site 3,

17
02:13.030 --> 02:19.270
router 4 should use the last IP address in the new subnet the switch the second last IP address in the

18
02:19.270 --> 02:26.740
subnet and the hosts should be allocated IP addresses from the first available IP address to the last

19
02:26.860 --> 02:28.430
available IP address.

20
02:28.510 --> 02:32.530
You're gonna configure the IP addresses in the subnet manually.

21
02:32.530 --> 02:39.850
Previously we used DHCP to allocate IP addresses to PCs but in this subnet, you're gonna use static

22
02:39.850 --> 02:41.680
IP addresses.

23
02:41.680 --> 02:48.910
Now once you've configured the network verify that PCs can access cisco.com and facebook.com

24
02:48.910 --> 02:56.350
using their browsers, cisco.com and facebook.com are websites on the Internet.

25
02:56.350 --> 03:05.860
You need to verify that your PCs, PC 6 7 and 8 can access the Internet as well as choose a PC

26
03:05.860 --> 03:12.920
in site 1 and site 2 and make sure that they can also access cisco.com and facebook.com

27
03:13.930 --> 03:20.410
So can you complete this lab, download the packet tracer file and see if you can complete the lab

28
03:20.410 --> 03:21.400
yourself.

29
03:21.400 --> 03:24.940
Otherwise watch the next video where I complete the lab.
