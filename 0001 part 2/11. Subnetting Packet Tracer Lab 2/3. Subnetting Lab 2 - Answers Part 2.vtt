00:06.650 --> 00:13.420
Okay so that means I need to configure router 4 and the Internet router so I'll do router 4 first

1
00:24.140 --> 00:25.230
interface serial

2
00:25.280 --> 00:27.190
010

3
00:27.320 --> 00:29.440
that's this interface.

4
00:31.670 --> 00:37.810
Now in the real world you could use commands such as Show CDP neighbors to verify neighbor connectivity.

5
00:37.930 --> 00:44.050
If you're not sure how interfaces are connected and you wanna verify interface connectivity.

6
00:44.050 --> 00:50.200
So this is definitely the local interface connected to the Internet router.

7
00:50.680 --> 01:00.820
So on that interface, interface serial 010 IP address 192 168 1 117 first IP address and subnet

8
01:00.850 --> 01:03.820
is one more than the subnet address

9
01:07.180 --> 01:14.480
and because this is a slash 30 the last IP address is simply the next IP address in that subnet interface

10
01:14.490 --> 01:15.170
serial.

11
01:15.220 --> 01:19.300
020 IP address 192 168.

12
01:19.400 --> 01:30.910
We're in the subnet so it would be 118 1 118 slash 30 mask.

13
01:30.940 --> 01:35.950
So can we ping the other side.

14
01:36.010 --> 01:41.030
Yes, we can and we can see that on OSPF neighbor relationship has been established.

15
01:41.200 --> 01:43.840
So back on router 4

16
01:46.860 --> 01:49.390
OSPF neighbor relationship is established.

17
01:49.560 --> 01:59.580
We've learnt a default route via the Internet router so IP domain lookup, IP name server is gonna be

18
01:59.580 --> 02:10.350
Google ping Cisco.com, we can ping Cisco.com, can we ping Facebook.com, yes, we can. So I've

19
02:10.350 --> 02:18.540
configured the WAN links and updated them per the new subnets that we have the next step is to configure

20
02:19.200 --> 02:35.030
the subnet. So we need to use this subnet for this local area network now the way that you work out first

21
02:35.030 --> 02:46.890
host, last host broadcast is once again first host is simply the next IP address after the subnet. So

22
02:46.910 --> 02:53.750
binary it would look like that, host portion is set to zeros except for the last bit which is set to

23
02:53.750 --> 03:02.840
1 but in decimal it's simply add 1 to the network portion. The broadcast would be one less than the next

24
03:02.840 --> 03:14.630
subnet so the next subnet is 80 so the broadcast would be 79 and to work out the broadcast

25
03:14.630 --> 03:19.340
portion you fill the host portion with binary ones

26
03:22.290 --> 03:33.630
and again we can verify that we've done a right 79 it looks like this in binary so 0100 followed

27
03:33.630 --> 03:44.040
by four ones, so that's correct and then the last hosts in the subnet is 1 less than the broadcast address

28
03:44.060 --> 03:51.210
so 78 and if you want to work it out in binary you set the host portion to binary ones except for the

29
03:51.210 --> 03:58.860
last bit which is set to zero, host portion for subnet looks like that filled with zeros broadcast is

30
03:58.860 --> 04:05.910
filled with ones, first host is filled with zeros except for the last bit which is set to 1, the last host

31
04:06.630 --> 04:12.720
has it filled with ones except for the last bit which is set to 0 so the last IP address in this subnet

32
04:12.750 --> 04:15.750
which we need to use on router 4 is 79.

33
04:15.840 --> 04:18.590
So 192 168 1 79

34
04:21.370 --> 04:30.970
so on the Ethernet interface connecting to the switch gigabit 000 IP address 192 168 1

35
04:31.210 --> 04:33.550
and again it should be 78.

36
04:36.040 --> 04:46.330
Subnet is a slash 28, so slash 28 equals 8 plus 8 plus 8

37
04:49.660 --> 04:54.550
plus 1 2 3 4 binary ones.

38
04:57.370 --> 05:08.740
So it's 255 255 255, four binary ones in an octet would look like that followed by four zeros which gives

39
05:08.740 --> 05:11.560
us 240, so this is 240

40
05:15.740 --> 05:20.990
if you wanna verify it again in our calculator, 240 looks like that

41
05:25.390 --> 05:28.240
switch needs to be configured with the

42
05:31.350 --> 05:38.160
second last IP address. I didn't do that here but it's essentially one less than the last IP address

43
05:38.640 --> 05:40.950
so the switch needs to be configured with 77

44
05:48.290 --> 05:53.010
so CONF T interface VLAN 1 IP address 192 168 1

45
05:56.670 --> 06:14.150
77 slash 28. Can we ping 192 168 1 78 so can the switch ping the router make sure that I've done

46
06:14.150 --> 06:16.850
it right, so show IP interface brief

47
06:19.740 --> 06:22.370
switch should hopefully be able to ping itself,

48
06:27.100 --> 06:28.530
can ping itself.

49
06:28.540 --> 06:30.340
Let's see if we can ping the router again

50
06:39.480 --> 06:48.400
on the router show IP interface brief, can we ping ourselves, can we ping the switch.

51
06:59.010 --> 07:01.820
Now notice the switch has some old configuration on it.

52
07:11.700 --> 07:18.510
So that may be causing problems sometimes in packet tracer when you make changes things break you may

53
07:18.510 --> 07:24.940
have to restart packet tracer let's just make sure that I haven't done something dumb that all looks

54
07:24.940 --> 07:33.280
right, that all looks right shows CDP neighbor details we can see the Internet router

55
07:36.340 --> 07:40.300
we can also see the switch with the correct IP address.

56
07:43.650 --> 07:52.820
Local port is this, port on the other side is that, on the side shows CDP neighbors we can see the router

57
07:53.210 --> 08:02.150
on gigabit 101 that looks good let's see if I've done something wrong, what I'm gonna do at this point

58
08:02.150 --> 08:09.530
is save packet trace and started up again and see if that solves the problem otherwise, I'll check if

59
08:09.530 --> 08:15.410
I made a mistake, packet tracer has booted up again here's the router

60
08:18.790 --> 08:30.850
router 4, show run just to confirm that this IP address 192 168 1 78 slash 240 is configured on the

61
08:30.850 --> 08:31.330
router

62
08:35.340 --> 08:38.460
and on the switch, switch 3

63
08:45.850 --> 08:58.390
show run this IP address 192 168 1 77  slash 28 is configured on the switch that's the

64
08:59.020 --> 09:08.260
second last IP address so ping 192 168 1 77 switch can ping itself cannot ping the router

65
09:11.480 --> 09:12.770
still having problems.

66
09:19.910 --> 09:22.520
I'm gonna remove this default gateway command.

67
09:22.600 --> 09:24.430
Change it IP default gateway

68
09:28.930 --> 09:34.220
192 168 1 78

69
09:34.380 --> 09:37.020
Let's see if that solves the problems

70
09:39.630 --> 09:41.520
and it did, on the real world.

71
09:41.520 --> 09:44.070
That's not correct, in the real world

72
09:44.160 --> 09:50.970
you don't need a default gateway to access a local device but that's a problem in packet tracer.

73
09:50.970 --> 09:55.930
So the issue here was the switch wasn't working per 

74
09:56.070 --> 10:02.460
a real switch in the real world you wouldn't have to do that even though the default gateway is wrong

75
10:03.390 --> 10:06.180
because they are on the same subnet,

76
10:06.630 --> 10:10.100
they would still work.

77
10:10.950 --> 10:13.580
In other words they'd still be able to ping each other.

78
10:13.770 --> 10:16.660
Can the switch now ping Cisco.com.

79
10:16.830 --> 10:26.890
Now I've rebooted Packet Tracer so it may take it a while to sort itself out, packet tracer is great

80
10:27.130 --> 10:35.350
but it does sometimes do things that are not real-world and sometimes has weird issues but at least

81
10:35.350 --> 10:38.580
it gives us the ability to test things and to learn.

82
10:39.430 --> 10:41.710
Okay, so the switch can now ping Cisco.com

83
10:41.710 --> 10:42.760
So that's good,

84
10:42.790 --> 10:46.600
We have IP connectivity from the switch to the Internet.

85
10:46.600 --> 10:53.920
We then need to configure the PCs with the first IP addresses in the subnet.

86
10:54.020 --> 10:57.500
So on the PC FastEthernet zero interface

87
10:57.760 --> 11:01.420
192 168 1

88
11:01.690 --> 11:06.550
IP address is gonna be 65, first IP address in the subnet.

89
11:06.550 --> 11:21.100
So 65 subnet mask is 255 255 255 240, default gateway is gonna be 192 168 1 78 DNS server

90
11:21.610 --> 11:24.750
is gonna be Google.

91
11:24.970 --> 11:31.140
So hopefully this PC should be able to ping Cisco.com which it can and hopefully should be

92
11:31.140 --> 11:36.670
able to browse to Cisco.com which it can

93
11:36.720 --> 11:40.050
and what about facebook.com.

94
11:40.050 --> 11:43.890
You can also browse to facebook.com so that works well.

95
11:44.160 --> 11:57.470
Next PC, IP address is gonna be statically configured 192 168 1, it's gonna be 66 next IP address in

96
11:57.470 --> 12:11.370
the subnet 255 255 255 240 default gateway is gonna be 192 168 1 78, so can it ping Cisco.com

97
12:11.370 --> 12:14.370
spelled that wrong

98
12:17.350 --> 12:22.670
can't find the domain name let's just check that I configured the DNS forgot to do that.

99
12:22.670 --> 12:33.350
So DNS needs to be configured it can ping Cisco.com can it get to Cisco.com? Yes, it can.

100
12:33.470 --> 12:35.760
Can it get to facebook.com?

101
12:35.780 --> 12:37.180
Yes, it can.

102
12:37.370 --> 12:50.970
And then the last PC in that subnet needs a static IP address of 192 168 1 67, 255 255 255

103
12:50.970 --> 13:05.200
240, default gateways 192 168 1 78, DNS server is Google we should be able to ping Cisco.com

104
13:05.320 --> 13:13.210
which we can and hopefully at this point we'll be able to browse to Cisco which we can and browse to

105
13:13.210 --> 13:15.760
facebook.com which we can.

106
13:15.760 --> 13:19.670
So I've successfully completed this lab.

107
13:20.080 --> 13:30.220
I've taken the subnet and broken it up into as many subnets as possible each having 8 hosts per subnet.

108
13:30.220 --> 13:31.840
That's what we did there.

109
13:31.930 --> 13:41.530
Then I took the last subnet and subnet ID it again and used these two subnets for the WAN links.

110
13:41.680 --> 13:50.500
Notice we still have these two subnets available and these two subnets available, so we've conserved

111
13:50.530 --> 13:56.500
IP addresses in our network rather than using a slash 26 which is very wasteful.

112
13:56.500 --> 14:05.230
On a WAN link we're using slash 30s on two WAN links and we've used one of the subnets for a site and

113
14:05.230 --> 14:06.280
we've got more spare.

114
14:06.610 --> 14:10.040
So what we should do is subnet this one as well.

115
14:10.120 --> 14:15.580
So what you would do in the real world is make this a slash 30 and better utilize your IP addresses

116
14:16.420 --> 14:18.250
but that's okay for this lab.

117
14:18.340 --> 14:19.990
I've completed this lab.

118
14:20.020 --> 14:21.100
How did you do?

119
14:21.100 --> 14:24.300
Were you able to complete the lab yourself.

120
14:24.310 --> 14:27.850
IP subnetting is really important for the CCNA exam.

121
14:27.880 --> 14:34.750
Make sure you understand how to use variable length, subnet masks like I've done here.

122
14:34.750 --> 14:40.090
Make sure that you understand how to subnet and how to allocate IP addresses to devices in subnets.
