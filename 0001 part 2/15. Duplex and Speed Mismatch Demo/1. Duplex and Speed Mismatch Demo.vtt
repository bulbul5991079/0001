Some points to remember with regards to speed and duplex negotiation and mismatches. Duplex and speed

1
00:07.530 --> 00:15.900
mismatches occur when auto-negotiation fails or when manual configurations are mismatched.

2
00:15.900 --> 00:21.600
So, for example, one side is configured to use full-duplex and the other side is configured to use half

3
00:21.600 --> 00:29.220
duplex auto-negotiation may fail because of physical problems in the network such as cabling problems

4
00:29.640 --> 00:36.400
or a hub somewhere in the network duplex mismatches do cause performance problems.

5
00:36.660 --> 00:46.230
Your pings may succeed but the movement of large files may be negatively affected and UDP may especially

6
00:46.500 --> 00:53.470
have problems with recovering from duplex mismatch issues so a quick bit of history.

7
00:53.590 --> 00:58.880
Originally ethernet was half duplex because devices were connected to hubs.

8
00:59.050 --> 01:06.370
So a decision was made that when you can't negotiate with the other side you would revert back to 10

9
01:06.370 --> 01:11.990
meg half-duplex older devices weren't designed to auto- negotiate.

10
01:12.070 --> 01:19.660
So the auto-negotiating device would revert back to half-duplex mode if it wasn't able to negotiate

11
01:19.660 --> 01:27.340
with the other side because it assumed that that device must only support half-duplex. Auto-negotiation

12
01:27.340 --> 01:33.130
of speed and duplex didn't work well in the old days and often caused problems with the speed and duplex

13
01:33.130 --> 01:34.240
mismatch.

14
01:34.690 --> 01:41.170
If one side is using half-duplex and the other side is using full-duplex, the full-duplex side thinks

15
01:41.260 --> 01:45.540
that it can transmit it any time even when it's receiving traffic.

16
01:45.580 --> 01:52.320
The half-duplex side however because it uses carrier sense multiple access collision detection or CSMA

17
01:52.360 --> 01:56.990
slash CD will want the line to be clear before transmitting.

18
01:57.220 --> 02:02.860
And when it does transmit and the packet is transmitted by the other side running at full-duplex a collision

19
02:02.860 --> 02:03.790
occurs.

20
02:04.090 --> 02:09.940
So the half duplex side will back off because of the collision and then try and transmit again when

21
02:09.940 --> 02:16.780
the line is clear and we'll have the constant issue of late collisions with the full-duplex side is

22
02:16.780 --> 02:20.680
transmitting data and can starve the half duplex side.

23
02:20.680 --> 02:25.930
In other words, it can use up all the bandwidth causing a lot of collisions and retransmissions on the

24
02:25.930 --> 02:31.900
half-duplex side this would cause the frames on the half-duplex side to que up and eventually be dropped.

25
02:32.590 --> 02:33.790
When looking for problems

26
02:33.790 --> 02:39.180
have a look at the areas which I'll demonstrate in a moment on the full-duplex side you will see errors

27
02:39.190 --> 02:46.620
such as CRC errors or runts, on the half-duplex side you typically see late collisions and perhaps

28
02:46.620 --> 02:52.750
buffer overloading, management systems from companies such as solar winds and others allow you to see

29
02:52.750 --> 02:58.480
where you've got Duplex problems on your network and help you resolve these issues more easily.
