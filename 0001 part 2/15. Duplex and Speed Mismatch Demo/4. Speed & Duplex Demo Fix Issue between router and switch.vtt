00:00.870 --> 00:03.450
Instructor: So let's fix this problem

00:03.450 --> 00:07.950
between router one and 2950-1.

00:07.950 --> 00:10.920
So on the router, it's currently configured

00:10.920 --> 00:12.543
to use a speed of 100.

00:13.770 --> 00:17.733
So I'm going to set the speed to auto.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.753
This router doesn't give me the option to set duplex.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.850
So show run interface f0.

00:26.850 --> 00:28.350
Speed is auto.

00:28.350 --> 00:30.543
Show interface f0.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.890
Speed is still half-duplex.

00:34.890 --> 00:38.430
The router can't negotiate with the switch.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.620
So once again, it moves

00:40.620 --> 00:44.220
to a full back position of 10 meg half-duplex.

00:44.220 --> 00:47.760
And this is what has caused a lot of problems in the past.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.190
Because the one side such as the router

00:50.190 --> 00:52.680
can't negotiate with the other side,

00:52.680 --> 00:56.280
it simply moves to the lowest possible speed

00:56.280 --> 00:58.980
which is half-duplex, 10 megabits per second

00:58.980 --> 01:01.593
whereas the switch is using full duplex.

01:02.850 --> 01:06.990
So on the switch show run interface f0/3.

01:06.990 --> 01:07.920
Speed is 10.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.690
Duplex is full.

01:09.690 --> 01:13.833
Let's change that to speed,

01:15.480 --> 01:18.227
or rather speed auto duplex.

01:24.450 --> 01:25.283
Auto.

01:29.820 --> 01:33.180
Show run interface f0/3.

01:33.180 --> 01:36.843
No configuration, show interface f0/3.

01:38.070 --> 01:42.660
Notice it is now using 100 meg, full-duplex.

01:42.660 --> 01:47.660
And on the router we are getting 100 meg, full-duplex.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.203
So that's a lot better.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.160
The router and the switch have negotiated correctly

01:56.160 --> 02:00.093
to use 100 megabits per second, full-duplex.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.023
So can we ping router two?

02:04.950 --> 02:05.943
Yes, we can.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.423
Let's do a large ping.

02:13.740 --> 02:15.213
Large datagram size.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.883
Pings are being sent without any problems.

02:23.130 --> 02:26.460
We are not seeing any late collisions at the moment

02:26.460 --> 02:30.660
because the speed and duplex have negotiated properly.

02:30.660 --> 02:34.203
This may indicate a problem somewhere else in the network,

02:36.780 --> 02:39.270
but at the moment everything looks good.

02:39.270 --> 02:41.643
Show interface f0.

02:43.230 --> 02:46.680
Now we still see late collisions,

02:46.680 --> 02:49.620
but that's because of the previous counters.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.850
So I'm gonna clear the counters

02:52.860 --> 02:57.000
and then do the command show interface f0 again.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.943
And notice we see zero late collisions.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.170
So when looking at your output,

03:04.170 --> 03:07.140
be careful of the information.

03:07.140 --> 03:08.193
Clear counters.

03:10.380 --> 03:13.563
And we could specify a specific interface.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.830
Allows us to clear the counters

03:16.830 --> 03:21.330
on that interface so that we see fresh information.

03:21.330 --> 03:23.943
So once again, if we ping 10.1.1.2.

03:29.615 --> 03:31.170
1,000 pings.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.613
Large packet size.

03:35.130 --> 03:38.550
We're sending some traffic on this side.

03:38.550 --> 03:41.163
Show interface f0/3.

03:43.731 --> 03:46.713
We've got the input errors and CRC, so clear counters.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.347
F0/3.

03:51.750 --> 03:54.813
we don't see any input errors and CRCs.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.160
Now obviously you need to monitor that

03:59.160 --> 04:00.840
over a period of time.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.040
So we are seeing a certain number

04:02.040 --> 04:05.130
of packets in and a certain number of packets out.

04:05.130 --> 04:06.960
So traffic is definitely being sent

04:06.960 --> 04:10.680
and received under this interface.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.300
We are not seeing any input errors

04:12.300 --> 04:15.000
which is better than what we saw last time,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.240
but you just need to monitor that for a period of time.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.893
On the router, show interface f0,

04:22.110 --> 04:24.150
we see the number of packets input,

04:24.150 --> 04:26.010
number of packets output.

04:26.010 --> 04:29.130
We have no late collisions at the moment.

04:29.130 --> 04:32.850
So that's a lot better than what we saw previously.

04:32.850 --> 04:37.560
Now on this switch, we still seeing another problem

04:37.560 --> 04:41.823
with a duplex mismatch to switch two.

04:45.420 --> 04:48.063
So this connection here has a duplex problem.
