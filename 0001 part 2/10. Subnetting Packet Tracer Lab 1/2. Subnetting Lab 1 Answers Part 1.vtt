00:06.440 --> 00:15.650
In this network, we've been told to subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 0 slash 24 into 4 subnets.

1
00:15.670 --> 00:24.190
In other words, we need a subnet for site 1, site 2, this serial link and this serial link.

2
00:24.190 --> 00:29.760
Now we haven't been told to use a slash 30 mask on the serial links.

3
00:29.770 --> 00:37.090
We'll do that in a separate video so all we need to do at this point is take 1 9 2 1 6 8 1.  

4
00:37.150 --> 00:42.460
0 slash 24 and subnet that into 4 subnets.

5
00:42.460 --> 00:49.750
Now when we look at a network address such as 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 0 we need to determine which part is the

6
00:49.750 --> 00:54.670
network and which part is the host portion.

7
00:54.670 --> 00:58.530
Currently, this portion is the network portion.

8
00:59.560 --> 01:09.860
We can't change the network portion but we can manipulate and change the host portion of the address.

9
01:09.910 --> 01:15.500
So in other words what we can do is change this last octet.

10
01:15.610 --> 01:23.320
The reason why we can't manipulate the first three octets is because that's part of the network, 24

11
01:23.320 --> 01:28.870
essentially means that we have 24 binary ones.

12
01:28.870 --> 01:31.800
Now you don't have spaces in an octet like this.

13
01:31.810 --> 01:41.990
I'm just doing it to make it easier to read, but essentially 24 means that we have 24 ones in the subnet

14
01:41.990 --> 01:55.300
mask, so that's 24 binary ones which essentially equates to 255 255 255 0.

15
01:55.300 --> 02:02.590
It's important that you know how to convert decimal to binary, this binary value equates to decimal

16
02:02.740 --> 02:09.000
255 so the host portion of the address is once again that portion.

17
02:09.190 --> 02:16.030
This portion is the network portion we can't manipulate the network portion but to the host portion

18
02:16.450 --> 02:20.890
consisting of eight binary zeros can be manipulated.

19
02:20.890 --> 02:28.990
Now when we subnet, think of subnetting kind of like stealing bits we're going to steal bits from the

20
02:28.990 --> 02:30.310
host portion.

21
02:30.310 --> 02:37.560
We need to work out how many bits are required for the number of subnets that we need, in this example

22
02:37.570 --> 02:39.840
we need four subnets.

23
02:39.840 --> 02:43.990
Now, when it comes to subnetting there are two formulas that you need to know.

24
02:44.070 --> 02:48.680
2 to the power of N and 2 to the power of N minus 2.

25
02:48.780 --> 02:57.590
This formula is used when we ask for subnets which is what we've been asked in this question.

26
02:57.690 --> 03:02.140
This formula we need to use when we're asked for a certain number of hosts.

27
03:02.220 --> 03:10.980
So if we were asked to subnet this subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 0 slash 24 and create as many subnets as possible

28
03:11.400 --> 03:18.210
each having 4 hosts we would use 2 to the power of N where N is the number of bits that are required

29
03:18.600 --> 03:20.020
minus 2.

30
03:20.040 --> 03:26.490
So if we needed to get 4 hosts we would actually need 2 to the power of 3 minus 2 which would

31
03:26.490 --> 03:31.500
be 2 to the power of 3, which is 8 minus 2 which means that we would be able to have 6 hosts

32
03:31.500 --> 03:33.440
per subnet.

33
03:33.510 --> 03:39.920
We need to subtract 2 because of broadcast and network address but we don't need that.

34
03:40.080 --> 03:46.590
When asked for networks, 2 to the power of 2 equals 4 which is what we need for the number of

35
03:46.590 --> 03:49.060
subnets that we've been asked to create.

36
03:49.080 --> 03:54.020
This is the number of bits that we're stealing or using for the subnet portion.

37
03:54.060 --> 03:59.780
This is the number of bits that we would keep for the host portion.

38
03:59.810 --> 04:06.470
Now, we're not using that formula so I can basically scratch that from our example.

39
04:06.560 --> 04:10.930
So basically remove that, we are not using that formula.

40
04:11.060 --> 04:14.780
In this example, this is the formula that we need.

41
04:14.780 --> 04:21.590
And once again that's because we've been asked 4 subnets we haven't been asked for hosts.

42
04:21.860 --> 04:28.310
Now, 2 to the power of 1 equals 2, that doesn't give us enough subnets, 2 to the power of 2 gives

43
04:28.310 --> 04:35.540
us 4 subnets, 2 to the power of 3 gives us 8 subnets, 2 to the power of 4 would give

44
04:35.540 --> 04:41.960
us 16 subnets, we don't need that many we only need 4 subnets.

45
04:42.230 --> 04:50.300
So all we need to do is use 2 bits which means we can steal 2 bits from the host portion for our

46
04:50.300 --> 04:51.470
subnet portion.

47
04:52.220 --> 05:03.560
So the host portion is now only 6 bits in length, the subnet portion is now 2 bits in length.

48
05:03.560 --> 05:04.790
So I'll write it like that.

49
05:04.850 --> 05:11.570
Once again there's obviously no spaces here in binary but that hopefully just makes it easier to read.

50
05:11.690 --> 05:20.740
So we're going to steal 2 bits from the host portion and allocate that to the subnet portion.

51
05:20.770 --> 05:23.880
So how many bits are part of the network and subnet.

52
05:24.100 --> 05:28.240
We've got our 8 bits from our original example.

53
05:28.240 --> 05:33.470
An additional 8 bits from our original example plus 8 bits.

54
05:33.580 --> 05:38.040
So that's 16 plus 1 plus 1.

55
05:38.080 --> 05:48.010
So, in other words, this is now a slash 26 subnet it's no longer slash 24 because we've stolen

56
05:48.040 --> 05:52.950
bits from the host portion for the network portion.

57
05:53.170 --> 05:58.570
So the first network that we have is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 0.

58
05:58.750 --> 06:03.530
Look at these 8 binary bits to make it easier to read.

59
06:03.640 --> 06:11.230
Notice we've got 8 binary bits, I've just split them up with spaces here to make it easier to demonstrate

60
06:11.710 --> 06:14.150
which part is subnet, which part is host.

61
06:14.170 --> 06:21.670
But notice there are 8 binary bits there, 8 binary bits equates to 0 in decimal.

62
06:21.670 --> 06:26.450
So the network is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 0 slash 26.

63
06:26.500 --> 06:28.680
That's our first network.

64
06:28.810 --> 06:31.270
Now what's the second network.

65
06:31.270 --> 06:34.830
The second network is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1

66
06:34.990 --> 06:41.350
dot and what we do now is we just go through the different binary options.

67
06:41.350 --> 06:44.440
This is 0 0 this is 0 1.

68
06:44.500 --> 06:49.030
This one would be 1 0 and this would be 1 1.

69
06:49.030 --> 06:52.930
So those are the different binary options that we have.

70
06:52.930 --> 07:01.200
So if we'll look at this network that second binary bit is set to a 1, what does this equal to, this

71
07:01.210 --> 07:04.920
equals to 64 in a decimal.

72
07:04.960 --> 07:08.350
So the next network is 64.

73
07:08.350 --> 07:10.180
What is this equal.

74
07:10.300 --> 07:12.710
It looks like this.

75
07:12.940 --> 07:15.650
Which equals 128.

76
07:15.650 --> 07:24.340
Now, as soon as you've worked out this second subnet you can simply do addition by that number.

77
07:24.340 --> 07:32.620
So 0 plus 64, 64 plus 64 is 128 plus 64 is 192.

78
07:32.830 --> 07:39.760
But if you look at the binary it's 128 plus 64, which equals 192.

79
07:39.760 --> 07:46.460
So there are our 4 subnets that we've been asked to work out in this example.

80
07:46.540 --> 07:51.370
So we've got 4 subnets the first one is for site 1, the second one is for the link between router

81
07:51.370 --> 07:58.060
1, an Internet router, third one is for site 2, fourth one is for the link between router 2 and

82
07:58.090 --> 08:05.480
the Internet router, so the first subnet would be 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 0 slash 26.

83
08:05.800 --> 08:08.540
And I'll zoom in here to make it clearer.

84
08:08.920 --> 08:11.190
So that's our first subnet

85
08:11.350 --> 08:21.810
per our calculations, second subnet is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64 slash 26.

86
08:21.840 --> 08:27.870
Third one is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 128 slash 26.

87
08:27.870 --> 08:38.320
And the last one is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 192 slash 26 so those subnets are the subnets that we worked out

88
08:39.540 --> 08:46.700
so we need to now configure the network with this information in the first step we need to work out

89
08:46.700 --> 08:53.760
the subnets but now we need to configure the routers per the instructions so as an example the last

90
08:53.790 --> 08:58.950
IP in the subnet should be configured on router 1, second last IP address should be configured on the

91
08:58.950 --> 09:07.390
switch, third last IP address should be configured on the DHCP server per these instructions we also need

92
09:07.390 --> 09:15.150
to configure a DHCP pool on the DHCP server so I'm going to start with the subnet first and get that

93
09:15.160 --> 09:18.040
working and then I'll move to the other subnets.
