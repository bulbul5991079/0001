00:06.640 --> 00:12.490
Now, we've been told to configure router 1 with the last IP address in that subnet.

1
00:12.500 --> 00:19.640
Now, this is the subnet that we concentrating on initially, so let's start with that subnet.

2
00:19.770 --> 00:21.970
The way you work out first

3
00:21.990 --> 00:25.430
last and broadcast addresses as follows.

4
00:25.770 --> 00:32.310
The network has the host portion populated with binary zeros.

5
00:32.310 --> 00:35.470
So notice host portion is all zeros.

6
00:35.640 --> 00:43.590
The first host has the host portion populated with binary zeros except for the last bit which is set

7
00:43.600 --> 00:45.300
to a 1 in binary.

8
00:45.630 --> 00:53.910
So that's the first host in the subnet. The last host in the subnet has the host portion populated with

9
00:53.970 --> 01:02.310
binary ones except for the last bit which is set to binary 0 and I'll show you in a moment what that

10
01:02.310 --> 01:06.970
is but it's easier to work out the broadcast address first.

11
01:07.350 --> 01:13.500
So the broadcast address equals that subnet

12
01:16.960 --> 01:21.690
and the host portion is populated with binary ones.

13
01:22.150 --> 01:26.190
So it's 1 1 followed by 4 ones.

14
01:26.190 --> 01:31.510
Now you can work this out by saying 32 plus 16 plus 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1.

15
01:31.600 --> 01:39.040
But I find it easier to do the following if this is set to 1 and everything else is set to zeros so

16
01:39.040 --> 01:48.130
it looks like this, that equals 64 one less than that equals 63.

17
01:48.160 --> 01:52.060
So if you asked for something like this, what is the broadcast address?

18
01:52.060 --> 01:59.190
Have a look at the next subnet and subtract 1 to get to the broadcast address of the previous subnet.

19
01:59.350 --> 02:03.460
The next subnet is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 64.

20
02:03.460 --> 02:08.980
The broadcast address of the previous subnet is that subnet minus 1.

21
02:08.980 --> 02:13.320
So in other words it's 63 and then this is 62.

22
02:13.360 --> 02:21.750
So for this subnet that's the network and first host, this is the last and broadcast address.

23
02:21.940 --> 02:32.440
Second last which we need for this switch is essentially 1 less than that can work out the binary

24
02:32.890 --> 02:36.670
but it may be easier just to subtract 1 from the decimal.

25
02:36.670 --> 02:38.200
So that's 61.

26
02:38.620 --> 02:41.890
And the third last is 1 less than that which is 60

27
02:44.910 --> 02:50.770
so we now know the network, the first host, the broadcast the last host.

28
02:50.820 --> 02:54.420
Second last host and third last host.

29
02:54.420 --> 03:01.650
Easiest way to work this out is, to work out to the network and then work out the next network, one less

30
03:01.650 --> 03:08.730
then the next network gives you the broadcast address for the current subnet and then you can just subtract

31
03:08.730 --> 03:11.880
1 from that to get to the last host.

32
03:11.910 --> 03:18.330
Second last host and third last host, first host is equal to the network portion plus 1.

33
03:18.330 --> 03:20.340
So there are our values.

34
03:20.340 --> 03:26.590
That means we can now configure this router with the last IP address in the subnet.

35
03:26.700 --> 03:34.350
So currently on this router it only has a loopback interface configured it doesn't have an IP address

36
03:34.350 --> 03:35.400
configured on gigabit

37
03:35.430 --> 03:37.700
0 0 0.

38
03:37.710 --> 03:48.570
Remember the network 1 9 2 1 6 8 1.0 slash 26 has 2 bits that are part of the network portion 2

39
03:48.570 --> 03:49.830
binary bits.

40
03:50.130 --> 03:54.350
Looks like that which equals a 192.

41
03:55.050 --> 03:58.270
So we can configure the gigabit

42
03:58.330 --> 04:09.610
0 0 0 interface with an IP address of 1 8 2 1 6 8 1 62 because that's the last IP address in the subnet.

43
04:09.610 --> 04:15.940
So 62 and the mask is 2 5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5 1 92.

44
04:16.390 --> 04:20.650
And that's because these 2 bits are part of the network.

45
04:20.650 --> 04:28.710
So we've got 255 255 255, 2 bits there which equates to a 192.

46
04:29.060 --> 04:36.220
So show IP interface brief we can now ping our local IP address.

47
04:36.220 --> 04:41.530
The switch needs to be configured with the second last IP address in the subnet.

48
04:41.590 --> 04:47.770
Per these instructions so configure the switches with the second last IP address and then the DHCP servers

49
04:47.770 --> 04:50.440
with the third last IP address.

50
04:50.650 --> 04:53.440
So again here's our switch

51
04:56.220 --> 04:57.050
I'll give it a name.

52
04:57.150 --> 05:09.880
Switch 1 interface VLAN 1, no shut IP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 and the next IP address that we can

53
05:09.880 --> 05:16.200
use is 61 2 5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5 1 92.

54
05:16.490 --> 05:27.940
So show IP interface brief, that's the IP address of the switch can the switch now ping the router, yes

55
05:27.940 --> 05:34.450
it can switch has been successfully configured, router has been successfully configured, let's configure

56
05:34.450 --> 05:42.340
the DHCP server so on the Ethernet interface we're going to configure a static IP address of 1 9 2 1 6 8

57
05:42.340 --> 05:50.740
1 and the IP address will be 60 in this example third last IP address subnet mask will be 2 5 5 2

58
05:50.740 --> 05:52.900
5 5 2 5 5 1 92.

59
05:52.990 --> 06:03.250
Now the default gateway will be the router 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 and the router once again has IP address 62 so

60
06:03.320 --> 06:13.240
62, DNS server and this example will be 8.8.8.8 this is the internet DNS server it's

61
06:13.240 --> 06:22.700
configured with DNS names for cisco.com and facebook.com, so the server has been configured.

62
06:22.700 --> 06:25.610
Can we ping the switch?

63
06:25.610 --> 06:26.810
Yes we can.

64
06:26.810 --> 06:27.950
What about the router?

65
06:28.310 --> 06:30.130
Yes we can.

66
06:30.140 --> 06:37.820
So we've configured IP addresses and default gateways on the network devices.

67
06:37.820 --> 06:42.980
Now one thing I still need to do on the switch is specify a default gateway which will be the router,

68
06:43.490 --> 06:46.360
router has IP address 62

69
06:49.080 --> 06:59.470
so again the switch can ping the router, we've finished configuring the switch now on the DHCP server

70
06:59.560 --> 07:09.640
we need to configure a DHCP pool default gateway is going to be the router 62 DNS server is gonna

71
07:09.640 --> 07:18.160
be the Google DNS server and we can allocate IP addresses from 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 1.

72
07:18.160 --> 07:24.080
So from the first IP address in the subnet to a number that we decide.

73
07:24.340 --> 07:30.790
So we could as an example allocate 100 IP addresses, so I'll save that.

74
07:30.830 --> 07:38.330
So we've specified the pool name default gateway DNS server starting IP address in the pool and the

75
07:38.330 --> 07:44.610
number of IP addresses that can be allocated, now can I specify a hundred hosted addresses the answer

76
07:44.610 --> 07:53.400
is, No, I should actually specify only something like 50 because the subnet only supports 62 IP addresses

77
07:54.270 --> 08:00.930
so remember the formula, 2 to the power of something which is the number of bits minus 2 gives you the

78
08:00.930 --> 08:04.230
number of hosts that are supported in a subnet.

79
08:04.230 --> 08:07.030
Here we've got 6 binary bits.

80
08:07.170 --> 08:09.180
So 2 to the power of 6

81
08:09.240 --> 08:15.380
that's the number of bits in the host portion, what's 2 to the power of 6, 2 to the power 4

82
08:15.380 --> 08:19.880
is 16, 2 to the power of 5 equals 32

83
08:20.030 --> 08:31.970
2 to the power of 6 equals 64, so 64 minus 2 gives us 62 hosts that are supported in a subnet

84
08:32.570 --> 08:39.740
but we want to allocate some of those IP addresses to network devices so we don't want to allocate the

85
08:39.770 --> 08:50.540
full subnet to the DHCP server we'll only allocate a portion of the addresses to hosts via DHCP, so on

86
08:50.540 --> 08:59.870
PC 1, does the PC have an IP address? Yes it does, it's been allocated 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 3

87
09:00.470 --> 09:04.520
Can it ping the default gateway? Yes it can.

88
09:04.520 --> 09:14.570
PC1 as an example IP config it's also been allocated an IP address 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 2. Can it ping

89
09:15.310 --> 09:21.370
its default gateway? Yes, it can and on PC 2 do something similar.

90
09:21.680 --> 09:31.790
IP address has been allocated and it can ping its a default gateway, so we've successfully configured

91
09:33.080 --> 09:34.490
subnet 1.

92
09:34.790 --> 09:40.520
Now, we need to configure the serial link and then once I've done that I'll check whether these devices

93
09:40.520 --> 09:44.630
can access devices on the Internet and then I'll configure the other subnets.
