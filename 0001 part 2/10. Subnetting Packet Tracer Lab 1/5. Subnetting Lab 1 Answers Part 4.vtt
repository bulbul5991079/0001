00:06.490 --> 00:11.230
So on the subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 128 slash 26.

1
00:11.260 --> 00:16.030
We've been told to configure the router with the last IP address in the subnet.

2
00:16.030 --> 00:19.000
Now the next subnet is 192

3
00:19.030 --> 00:27.070
so the broadcast address for the subnet will be 191 which means that this router can be configured with

4
00:27.070 --> 00:28.810
190

5
00:28.810 --> 00:31.970
Have a look at the previous videos in this series.

6
00:32.050 --> 00:40.860
If you're not sure how I worked that out, so IP address 192 168 1, 192 is the next subnet 1

7
00:40.860 --> 00:49.720
91 is the broadcast, 190 is the last IP address in the subnet, subnet mask is that and we know

8
00:49.720 --> 00:58.310
that from our previous calculations, the switch needs to use the second IP address in the subnet. The

9
00:58.310 --> 01:08.720
router is configured with 190 so the switch, I'll change the name to switch 2 we'll simply use IP address

10
01:09.010 --> 01:18.660
192 168 1 189 so 1 less than the router

11
01:21.290 --> 01:26.680
no shut the interface so ping 192 168 1 189.

12
01:26.940 --> 01:28.770
That's our local IP address.

13
01:28.770 --> 01:30.680
Can we ping the router?

14
01:30.780 --> 01:32.360
Yes, we can.

15
01:32.360 --> 01:43.680
I'll also configure a default gateway on the switch pointing to the router, switch is configured, so the

16
01:43.680 --> 01:47.160
switch once again is using 189.

17
01:47.160 --> 01:49.930
The DNS server should use 188

18
01:53.150 --> 02:02.330
one less than the switch, so static IP address of the DHCP server is 192 168 188 subnet mask is 255

19
02:02.360 --> 02:16.340
255 255 192, default gateway is the router 192 168 1 190 again that's the IP address of the router DNS

20
02:16.360 --> 02:18.680
server will be Google.

21
02:19.050 --> 02:26.890
So on the server, can we ping the router, type that right.

22
02:27.920 --> 02:29.120
Yes, we can.

23
02:29.120 --> 02:31.910
Can we ping the switch?

24
02:31.910 --> 02:33.380
Yes, we can.

25
02:33.380 --> 02:33.860
Can we

26
02:33.860 --> 02:37.630
ping the DNS server?

27
02:37.760 --> 02:43.540
Not at the moment because we need to configure the serial interface of the router.

28
02:43.670 --> 02:52.970
But now let's configure the DHCP server, so DHCP I'll enable the DHCP service default gateway is gonna

29
02:52.970 --> 03:03.110
be 192 so 1, so 192 168 1 190 DNS server is Google, IP addresses that we'll allocate

30
03:03.360 --> 03:06.230
are 192 168 1.

31
03:06.230 --> 03:07.760
Now you need to be careful.

32
03:07.880 --> 03:13.750
The first host is one more than the subnet, so it's 129.

33
03:14.210 --> 03:15.460
Maximum number of hosts

34
03:15.470 --> 03:19.670
I'll allocate is 50 and I'll save that configuration.

35
03:19.880 --> 03:24.490
You could allocate more IP addresses in your pool or less if you wanted to so.

36
03:24.530 --> 03:29.990
So for instance only allocate 10, just depends how many IP addresses in your subnet you want to have

37
03:30.470 --> 03:32.040
for static IP addresses.

38
03:32.120 --> 03:41.930
How many IP addresses you want for dynamic IP addresses. So on the PC, IP config, IP address has been

39
03:41.930 --> 03:42.770
allocated.

40
03:42.950 --> 03:46.560
Ping 192 168 1 190.

41
03:46.640 --> 03:48.320
That's the router, 

42
03:48.320 --> 03:51.880
that's the switch, that's the DNS server.

43
03:51.950 --> 03:53.480
What about PC 5

44
03:53.540 --> 03:55.160
just do one more here.

45
03:55.340 --> 03:59.830
IP config, IP address has been allocated.

46
03:59.990 --> 04:02.680
So can we ping the router?

47
04:03.260 --> 04:04.430
Yes, we can.

48
04:04.430 --> 04:06.320
What about switch?

49
04:06.350 --> 04:07.670
Yes, we can.

50
04:07.670 --> 04:09.710
What about DNS server?

51
04:09.710 --> 04:10.960
Yes, we can.

52
04:11.000 --> 04:15.490
We won't be able to ping 192 168 1.1

53
04:15.680 --> 04:22.910
PC in the other subnet because we still need to configure this serial link, so let's configure the

54
04:22.910 --> 04:31.820
serial link the IP address of this router on the serial interface is gonna be one more than the subnet.

55
04:34.100 --> 04:36.520
So show IP interface brief.

56
04:36.830 --> 04:47.060
This serial interface needs to be configured with IP address 192 168 1 subnet is 192.

57
04:47.060 --> 04:53.390
So, first IP address will be 193 with that subnet mask.

58
04:53.510 --> 04:57.170
So can we ping 192 168 1 193.

59
04:57.170 --> 05:04.730
It won't work at this point because we need to configure the other side. So on this router show IP interface

60
05:04.730 --> 05:12.770
brief we still need to configure the zero interface it's currently down, so no shut that. IP address

61
05:12.770 --> 05:21.950
will be 192 168 1 and this is a little bit more difficult to work out the broadcast for the subnet.

62
05:22.160 --> 05:31.610
Again you just populate the host portion with binary ones and what you'll notice is it's full of ones.

63
05:31.820 --> 05:39.320
So that would equal 255, so one less than the broadcast is 254.

64
05:39.320 --> 05:49.380
So 254 subnet mask is that no shut the interface again so show IP interface brief according to this

65
05:49.380 --> 05:51.570
it's still down.

66
05:51.590 --> 05:54.800
Let's make sure that I've configured it right.

67
05:54.800 --> 05:56.480
Show IP interface brief, 

68
06:00.250 --> 06:07.320
I may have connected the wrong serial interface in this network and that looks like what I've done, wrong

69
06:07.320 --> 06:08.970
serial interface.

70
06:09.090 --> 06:12.120
So what I'll do is delete that serial interface.

71
06:12.120 --> 06:15.060
I'll fix it in your lab so you don't have that problem.

72
06:16.470 --> 06:27.120
That serial should be connected to that serial, so show IP interface brief this interface is up up

73
06:27.810 --> 06:31.120
so can we ping 192 168 1 254

74
06:31.170 --> 06:31.920
Yes, we can.

75
06:32.430 --> 06:41.040
So router 2 can ping the Internet router, so hopefully, these PCs can now ping the Internet which

76
06:41.040 --> 06:49.650
they can, notice they can ping cisco.com as an example and they can ping facebook.com.

77
06:49.650 --> 06:57.540
So going to the web browser on PC 3, can this PC get to cisco.com?

78
06:57.540 --> 06:58.950
Yes, it can.

79
06:58.980 --> 07:00.930
Can it get to facebook.com?

80
07:00.930 --> 07:02.400
Yes, it can.

81
07:02.400 --> 07:07.470
What about PC 5, web browser on PC 5.

82
07:07.470 --> 07:09.570
Can we get to cisco.com?

83
07:09.570 --> 07:10.950
Yes, we can.

84
07:10.950 --> 07:13.120
Can we get to facebook.com?

85
07:13.140 --> 07:14.290
Yes, we can.

86
07:14.340 --> 07:17.820
We can access these servers on the Internet.

87
07:17.910 --> 07:21.150
We've had to do quite a lot here, as a last test.

88
07:21.150 --> 07:29.640
Can the PCs in the 1 subnet ping PCs in the other subnet, so can we ping 192 168 1.

89
07:29.640 --> 07:30.310
1?

90
07:30.360 --> 07:31.080
Yes, we can.

91
07:31.410 --> 07:32.700
What about 1.2?

92
07:32.700 --> 07:33.990
Yes, we can.

93
07:33.990 --> 07:43.440
And if we trace to that, we are essentially sending traffic to router 2 then to the Internet router

94
07:43.770 --> 07:48.890
then to router 1 and then to the PC in the other subnet.

95
07:49.120 --> 07:54.250
Okay, so this was quite a complex lab we had to do a lot of things here, but I'm hoping it's helped you

96
07:54.250 --> 08:01.620
understand subnetting and way you use subnetting and how to use subnetting in a practical lab.
