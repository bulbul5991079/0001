This is a practical IP version 4 subnetting lab.

1
00:10.420 --> 00:17.050
Now, this is a practical lab helping you test and verify your knowledge of IP version 4 subnetting.

2
00:17.050 --> 00:23.860
We're not simply gonna talk about the theory of IP version 4 subnetting you need to subnet, but in

3
00:23.860 --> 00:28.080
addition configure the network and get it working.

4
00:28.360 --> 00:35.020
You need to configure IP addresses on routers, on switches, and on DHCP servers and then you need to configure

5
00:35.050 --> 00:41.300
the DHCP servers to allocate IP addresses to the clients in the correct subnet.

6
00:41.320 --> 00:48.880
So once again this is a practical demonstration and lab of IP version 4 subnetting, in this packet

7
00:48.880 --> 00:49.770
tracer lab.

8
00:49.780 --> 00:57.370
We have multiple sites, site 1 and site 2 connected via serial links to an Internet router.

9
00:57.490 --> 01:05.650
You need to configure the network as follows, you've been allocated subnet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1. 0 slash 24 and

10
01:05.650 --> 01:12.430
you need to subnet this network into 4 subnets as follows subnet 1 needs to be allocated to site 1

11
01:12.430 --> 01:22.360
subnet 2 to the serial link between router 1 and the Internet router, subnet 3 to site 2 and subnet

12
01:22.360 --> 01:27.470
4 to the link between router 2 and the Internet router.

13
01:27.640 --> 01:34.930
Now, we are not going to initially optimize the subnetting you're only gonna create 4 subnets and

14
01:34.930 --> 01:42.460
then split them across these four networks in a subsequent video we'll optimize the serial links to

15
01:42.460 --> 01:48.350
use a slash 30 mask and then make more subnets available for additional sites.

16
01:48.430 --> 01:52.690
But in this initial topology, you simply need to create 4 subnets.

17
01:52.900 --> 01:56.410
You should configure the router as per the instructions in the diagram.

18
01:56.410 --> 02:02.660
In other words this interface on router 1 should use the last IP address in the relevant subnet.

19
02:02.680 --> 02:08.260
This interface should use the first IP address in the subnet on the serial link.

20
02:08.260 --> 02:14.770
The Internet router is gonna use the last IP address in both subnets on the serial links and router

21
02:14.770 --> 02:22.300
2 will once again use the last IP address in the subnet on the Ethernet interface and to the first

22
02:22.330 --> 02:25.210
IP address on the serial interface.

23
02:25.210 --> 02:31.570
You need to configure the switches with the second to last IP address and the subnet and the DHCP servers

24
02:31.570 --> 02:40.990
with the third last IP address in the subnet, as an example at Site 1 the switch such 1 should be

25
02:40.990 --> 02:47.650
configured with the second last IP address and the subnet and the DHCP server with the third last IP

26
02:47.650 --> 02:48.590
address.

27
02:48.730 --> 02:55.630
The same should be done for switch 2, in site 2 and the third last IP address should be configured on

28
02:55.630 --> 02:59.280
the DHCP server at site 2.

29
02:59.320 --> 03:06.550
You also need to configure the DHCP servers to allocate IP addresses to the clients in the relevant subnets.

30
03:06.550 --> 03:11.850
So as an example DHCP server 1 should allocate IP addresses to PC 0,

31
03:12.010 --> 03:20.620
PC 1 and PC 2 in the subnet allocated to this network, DHCP server 2 should allocate IP addresses

32
03:20.950 --> 03:24.680
in the correct subnet to PC 3 4 and 5.

33
03:24.700 --> 03:31.270
Once you've done your configuration verify that PCs can access cisco.com and facebook.com

34
03:31.330 --> 03:33.100
using their browsers.

35
03:33.100 --> 03:38.380
The server 8.8.8.8 is configured as a DNS server.

36
03:39.130 --> 03:46.330
So think of this as the Google DNS server that is configured with A records for cisco.com and facebook

37
03:46.330 --> 03:47.430
.com

38
03:47.440 --> 03:54.040
So once you've got your network configured with the correct IP addresses your DHCP servers are allocating

39
03:54.280 --> 04:01.070
IP addresses to the clients, the clients should be able to access cisco.com and facebook.com,

40
04:01.120 --> 04:05.320
again this is the DNS server in the network.

41
04:05.530 --> 04:08.050
Okay, so can you complete this lab?

42
04:08.090 --> 04:14.550
Can you work out the relevant subnets, the relevant IP addresses, and configure the routers switches and

43
04:14.550 --> 04:18.410
DHCP servers to get this network working.

44
04:18.410 --> 04:23.230
Download the packet tracer file and see if you can complete the lab yourself.

45
04:23.270 --> 04:27.050
Otherwise watch the next video where I complete the lab.
