In this lab, we're going to configure default gateways and ensure that the devices in the network can

1
00:22.810 --> 00:23.740
ping one another.

2
00:24.520 --> 00:29.900
To do that, we need to configure and optimize HSRP or hot standby routing protocol.

3
00:30.400 --> 00:35.170
We're going to enable EIGRP on the core switches and ISR router.

4
00:35.890 --> 00:42.300
We're going to configure the PCs and the server with IP addresses as shown here.

5
00:42.760 --> 00:47.130
And then we're going to make sure that the PCs can oing each other as well as the server.

6
00:47.710 --> 00:52.180
And we need to verify connectivity between the switches and server and PCs.

7
00:53.230 --> 01:01.870
So as an example, this PC in VLAN 1 should be able to ping PC 2,PC three, the server and the

8
01:01.870 --> 01:10.580
access switches and the router, once this lab is completed. Can you complete this lab yourself? Download

9
01:10.600 --> 01:13.790
the attached packet tracer file and try it.

10
01:14.260 --> 01:18.670
It's not easy, but see if you can do it and get it working yourself.

11
01:19.240 --> 01:22.660
You need to be able to do this for the CCNA exam.
