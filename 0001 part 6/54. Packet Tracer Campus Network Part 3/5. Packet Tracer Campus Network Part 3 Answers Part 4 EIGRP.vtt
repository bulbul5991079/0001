00:14.460 --> 00:18.940
So here's the router show IP interface brief.

1
00:20.100 --> 00:25.740
We don't have any IP addresses configured on the router. So I'll configure the router

2
00:27.580 --> 00:36.640
with an IP address of 10.1.1.253/24 mask and no shut the interface.

3
00:38.820 --> 00:46.560
So can the router ping the HSRP IP address in VLAN 1 and the answer is yes it can.

4
00:47.640 --> 00:54.240
So what I'll do now is enable EIGRP in autonomous system 100 and I'll only enable

5
00:55.510 --> 00:56.260
EIGRP

6
00:58.260 --> 01:10.170
for network 10. So show IP EIGRP interfaces EIGRP is enabled on gigabit0/0/0.

7
01:13.100 --> 01:17.590
So on core 1, I'm going to enable EIGRP as well.

8
01:19.780 --> 01:26.620
So router EIGRP, we need to make sure that the autonomous system numbers are the same on this

9
01:26.620 --> 01:33.430
side we enabled EIGRP in autonomous system 100

10
01:36.730 --> 01:42.490
and here I'll enable it on all interfaces simply by doing that.

11
01:44.450 --> 01:48.600
I'll also configure no-auto summary, and I'll do the same over here.

12
01:50.720 --> 01:56.360
We don't want automatic summarization on EIGRP, on core 2

13
01:58.100 --> 02:03.610
router EIGRP 100 network 10 0/0/0

14
02:03.980 --> 02:05.360
no-auto summary.

15
02:07.170 --> 02:15.540
Notice we've got a lot of neighbor relationships because we are running EIGRP on multiple interfaces

16
02:16.020 --> 02:24.990
on VLAN 1 we have two peers. Show IP EIGRP neighbors notice we have multiple neighbor relationships

17
02:25.710 --> 02:29.170
the VLAN numbers are not showing properly on packet tracer

18
02:29.700 --> 02:37.110
but what we've got is we've got neighbor relationships to switch 1 or core 1 on multiple VLANs

19
02:37.890 --> 02:42.210
and we've got a neighbor relationship to the ISR router.

20
02:46.190 --> 02:49.920
On core 1 show IP EIGRP neighbor

21
02:50.510 --> 02:58.910
we also have multiple neighbor relationships in core 2 and one relationship to the ISR.

22
03:00.020 --> 03:09.410
We have VLAN 1 spanning this link all the way to the ISR, so hence core 1 can have a neighbor relationship

23
03:09.410 --> 03:11.300
directly to the ISR.

24
03:13.830 --> 03:22.560
So we've configured EIGRP in our network, can the PCs ping the ISR as an example, so can it ping

25
03:22.860 --> 03:24.820
10.1.1.253?

26
03:24.870 --> 03:25.710
Yes, it can.

27
03:26.610 --> 03:34.500
If I configured a loopback on the ISR router, that should be advertised and become available in the

28
03:34.500 --> 03:35.160
network.

29
03:35.880 --> 03:46.290
So as an example, if I configured a loopback on the ISR of quadruple one and then I went into

30
03:46.290 --> 03:51.030
EIGRP and I advertised that network through EIGRP.

31
03:52.810 --> 04:00.370
Core 1 should learn about that route, so show IP route shows us that route in the routing table

32
04:00.700 --> 04:04.660
and it was learnt via EIGRP.

33
04:06.920 --> 04:18.080
Notice the D for EIGRP we can ping that route from core 1 so on a PC such as PC 1, we should be

34
04:18.080 --> 04:26.870
able to ping the loopback of the ISR, which we can so EIGRP is successfully configured in

35
04:26.870 --> 04:27.650
this network.

36
04:28.390 --> 04:38.510
The next step is to configure the ISR router with DHCP on this interface and configure net and verify

37
04:38.510 --> 04:41.320
that the PCs can ping cisco.com.

38
04:41.750 --> 04:49.610
That means that they need to send a DNS request to the DNS server, which will resolve the IP address

39
04:49.970 --> 04:53.420
and tell the PCs the IP address of Cisco.
