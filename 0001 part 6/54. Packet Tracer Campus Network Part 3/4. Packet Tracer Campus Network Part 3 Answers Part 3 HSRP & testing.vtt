0
00:12.510 --> 00:27.650
So interface VLAN 100 stand by 1 IP 10.1.100.254, stand by 1 priority 200, standby 1 preemption.

1
00:29.700 --> 00:42.720
So looking at core 2 show run shows us that this is the configuration on VLAN 100 and the switch has become

2
00:42.720 --> 00:43.620
the active router.

3
00:46.980 --> 00:49.150
On core 1 we're going to do something similar.

4
00:50.190 --> 00:55.980
Standby 1 IP 10.1.100.254

5
00:58.080 --> 00:58.710
show

6
00:58.950 --> 01:08.330
standby still listening at the moment, but after a while, that should go to active.

7
01:08.340 --> 01:14.700
It's now speaking, in other words, sending out HSRP messages and notice it's now gone to stand by.

8
01:15.480 --> 01:23.070
So show standby on VLAN 100, the local router is in standby mode, 

9
01:23.490 --> 01:27.930
active router is core 2 again local

10
01:27.930 --> 01:29.640
router is standby.

11
01:31.760 --> 01:37.070
Now the last VLAN to configure and one not to forget is VLAN 1.

12
01:38.700 --> 01:46.020
Don't forget to configure VLAN 1, because your layer 2 switch is here at the access layer also

13
01:46.020 --> 01:47.250
need a default gateway.

14
01:48.420 --> 01:59.710
Show spanning-tree VLAN 1 local switch is the root, so we want to configure it as the HSRP primary.

15
01:59.760 --> 02:08.160
So standby 1 IP 10.1.1.254, standby 1 priority

16
02:09.200 --> 02:12.980
200 standby 1 preemption.

17
02:15.390 --> 02:16.350
So show run

18
02:17.340 --> 02:22.920
and we'll look at VLAN 1, that's the configuration.

19
02:25.490 --> 02:33.140
Configure core 2 interface VLAN 1 standby 1 IP 10.1.1.254.

20
02:35.000 --> 02:43.070
We can see that core 1 has become the active router for VLAN 1, so show standby

21
02:45.770 --> 02:48.700
for VLAN 1 core 1 is the active router.

22
02:49.610 --> 02:53.260
Same for VLAN 10, same for VLAN 30

23
02:54.800 --> 03:04.900
its standby for VLAN 100 and its standby for VLAN 20 on the side show

24
03:04.910 --> 03:05.690
standby

25
03:07.350 --> 03:15.040
VLAN 1 it's the standby router, standby for VLAN 10, it's active for VLAN 20

26
03:15.970 --> 03:17.770
standby for VLAN 30

27
03:18.760 --> 03:21.190
active for VLAN 100,

28
03:22.180 --> 03:22.910
so that's good.

29
03:22.930 --> 03:29.590
I think we've configured HSRP successfully on our core switches.

30
03:30.070 --> 03:32.320
Now we need to configure default gateways.

31
03:33.720 --> 03:45.390
So we've already configured PC 1 to use 10.1.10.254 as the default gateway, let's configure PC 2.

32
03:47.160 --> 03:48.960
So config on PC 2

33
03:52.950 --> 04:03.840
gateway will be 10.1.20.254 DNS server will be google, IP address will be 10.1.20.10

34
04:06.910 --> 04:13.750
/24 mask. So that's the IP address we need to use 10.1.20.10.

35
04:17.070 --> 04:26.250
Go to desktop command prompt IP config shows us that information can it ping its default gateway?

36
04:26.280 --> 04:27.120
Yes, it can.

37
04:28.080 --> 04:30.030
Can the PC ping

38
04:31.430 --> 04:32.510
PC 1?

39
04:36.480 --> 04:44.550
OK, so there you go, just took a bit of time, but notice now, PC 2 can ping PC 1. So back on

40
04:44.550 --> 04:45.330
PC 1

41
04:47.540 --> 04:50.180
can it ping PC 2?

42
04:50.540 --> 04:51.350
Yes, it can.

43
04:53.720 --> 05:02.480
Notice, if we look at the ARP cache we don't see a Mac address for PC 2 because to get to PC 2 traffic

44
05:02.480 --> 05:07.250
is going via the default gateway, which is the HSRP router

45
05:10.250 --> 05:13.370
and the same is true on PC 2.

46
05:15.880 --> 05:25.090
We need to configure PC 3, so gateway is going to be 10.1.30.254 DNS server is Google

47
05:27.630 --> 05:32.310
IP address will be 10.1.30.10/24 mask

48
05:34.470 --> 05:35.460
as shown here

49
05:38.340 --> 05:44.850
desktop command prompt IP config, that looks good.

50
05:46.540 --> 05:50.480
Can we ping PC 1?

51
05:50.830 --> 05:55.150
Yes, we can, can we ping PC 2?

52
05:56.320 --> 05:57.100
Yes, we can.

53
05:58.150 --> 05:59.250
So that looks great.

54
05:59.980 --> 06:03.210
But notice we won't be able to ping all switches.

55
06:03.940 --> 06:06.040
Why can't we ping the switch

56
06:09.250 --> 06:11.470
if we run a debug on that switch?

57
06:15.800 --> 06:24.440
So use the come on, debug IP ICMP, we should be able to see if traffic arrives after that switch and

58
06:24.440 --> 06:30.920
notice you can see it arriving so the ping gets to the switch, but it doesn't get back again

59
06:31.760 --> 06:36.950
and that's because we need to configure a default gateway on the switch.

60
06:39.690 --> 06:47.730
And to do that, we use the command IP default gateway and we specify our default gateway, which is

61
06:47.730 --> 06:56.340
the HSRP router, and now you can see that pings are succeeding. So I'll turn off debugging here

62
06:57.850 --> 07:05.860
command is un-all to turn off debugging, save the config while we're there and notice PC 3 can ping switch

63
07:05.860 --> 07:15.520
1 but can't ping switch 2 this switch here because again, we need to configure a default gateway.

64
07:18.340 --> 07:20.170
So show IP interface

65
07:20.290 --> 07:29.710
brief IP address is 10.1.1.2 show IP route shows us that we don't have a default gateway.

66
07:30.490 --> 07:33.040
So IP default gateway

67
07:34.670 --> 07:36.440
10.1.1.254

68
07:39.050 --> 07:45.720
show IP route default gateway is now configured. So back on PC3

69
07:46.630 --> 07:50.240
hopefully we should be able to ping switch 2 which we can.

70
07:50.750 --> 07:52.000
Pings are now succeeding.

71
07:54.800 --> 07:56.090
We need to do something similar

72
07:59.150 --> 08:05.600
on switch 3, access switch 3 IP default gateway

73
08:11.670 --> 08:13.980
10.1.1.254

74
08:16.530 --> 08:23.760
show IP route shows us that we do have a default gateway configured, I'll save the configuration.

75
08:25.210 --> 08:29.140
So on PC 3 can we ping access 3?

76
08:32.170 --> 08:40.870
Took a while, but the answer is yes, we can now ping access 3. Can we ping the server, which

77
08:40.870 --> 08:43.450
has IP address 10.100.100?

78
08:45.060 --> 08:47.430
Answer is no, because we need to configure the server.

79
08:53.170 --> 09:02.350
So on the server default gateway will be 10.1.100.254 we'll set to the DNS server to Google,

80
09:04.670 --> 09:09.740
IP address will be 10.1.100.100/24 mask.

81
09:12.240 --> 09:20.740
Open up a CMD prompt or command prompt IP config shows us the IP address of the server.

82
09:21.300 --> 09:23.730
Can it ping PC 1?

83
09:26.350 --> 09:27.220
Yes, it can.

84
09:28.090 --> 09:29.950
What about PC 2?

85
09:30.370 --> 09:31.270
Yes, it can.

86
09:31.870 --> 09:33.370
What about PC three?

87
09:33.550 --> 09:34.460
Yes, it can.

88
09:35.350 --> 09:38.020
Can the PC ping the server?

89
09:39.370 --> 09:41.530
Yes, PC 3 can ping the server.

90
09:42.340 --> 09:44.020
What about PC 2?

91
09:46.760 --> 09:47.600
Yes, it can.

92
09:48.440 --> 09:50.000
What about PC 1?

93
09:52.260 --> 09:53.040
Yes, it can.

94
09:54.570 --> 10:02.220
So we've successfully configured IP connectivity in the campus, we've configured HSRP, but we still

95
10:02.220 --> 10:08.700
need to do, however, is configure EIGRP on the core router and on the ISR.
