In this example, I've got NPM connected to four routers, which in turn are connected to my local

1
00:07.350 --> 00:14.850
area network, that means that my virtual GNS3 network is connected to my physical network.

2
00:15.600 --> 00:23.700
This allows me to use NPM running within VMware, connected to my GNS3 routers to monitor

3
00:23.850 --> 00:25.540
links on the Internet.

4
00:26.310 --> 00:33.360
So in this example, I'm monitoring traffic from my local network in the U.K. through British Telecom

5
00:33.540 --> 00:35.180
to Salesforce.com.

6
00:35.850 --> 00:45.030
So it's possible to get NPM to connect to Jenas three network, but also bridge it to the outside world

7
00:45.450 --> 00:51.600
so that you can integrate GNS3 with physical networks and connect to the Internet.
