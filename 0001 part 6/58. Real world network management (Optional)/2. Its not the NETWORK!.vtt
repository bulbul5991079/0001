Managing today's complex hybrid IT networks requires new tools, net path, a revolutionary new feature

1
00:07.460 --> 00:08.090
of solar winds.

2
00:08.090 --> 00:12.680
Network Performance Monitor is transforming the way administrators visualize and troubleshoot their

3
00:12.680 --> 00:15.320
networks. Using advanced traffic simulation, 

4
00:15.470 --> 00:21.830
Net Path continuously discovers and analyzes dynamic network paths, see from source to destination and

5
00:21.830 --> 00:23.240
all the hops in between.

6
00:23.780 --> 00:29.600
Here's an example path to Google.com with traffic originating on our network routed to the ISP through

7
00:29.600 --> 00:32.900
Google's internal network and finally to the destination servers.

8
00:33.980 --> 00:39.410
Net Path also collects detailed performance metrics for each network node in link, making it easy to

9
00:39.410 --> 00:40.340
spot bottlenecks.

10
00:40.730 --> 00:45.950
In this example, our router has three incoming links, but only one is experiencing increased latency

11
00:46.430 --> 00:48.530
by correlating real transit impact

12
00:48.530 --> 00:53.900
with NPM's Comprehensive Performance Metrics, Net Path immediately identifies the root cause of the

13
00:53.900 --> 00:54.380
problem.

14
00:54.830 --> 01:01.280
In this instance, its high interface utilization look inside the cloud and troubleshoot with unprecedented

15
01:01.280 --> 01:01.910
visibility.

16
01:02.390 --> 01:08.750
Follow hop by hop Internet paths, including all provider interlinks, which deliver service. For the first

17
01:08.750 --> 01:09.350
time

18
01:09.350 --> 01:12.850
you can inspect carrier networks and assist your ISPs helpdesk.

19
01:13.400 --> 01:19.070
This allows you to address issues with precise, actionable information about the problem in their network.

20
01:19.520 --> 01:22.820
Analyze past performance problems with net path

21
01:22.820 --> 01:27.650
you can travel back in time to compare routing changes and diagnose what was happening.

22
01:28.370 --> 01:31.570
Visualizing complete network path is finally easy.

23
01:32.120 --> 01:37.490
Specify source and destination at branch offices and configure your most important services.

24
01:38.120 --> 01:44.690
Diagnose service issues from Salesforce.com, Exchange or any other TCP based service in just a few minutes,

25
01:45.290 --> 01:50.360
pinpoint network problems and solve them faster with the breakthrough capabilities of NetPath.
