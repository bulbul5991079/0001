00:00.240 --> 00:05.120
So what are the best practices, what should you be doing in a live environment? Now

1
00:05.390 --> 00:07.800
best practices state that you should use both.

2
00:08.720 --> 00:15.410
You should use polling-based or query-based as well as event-based network management protocols as part

3
00:15.410 --> 00:17.060
of your network management solution.

4
00:18.260 --> 00:23.720
Now, it doesn't help just to receive a large amount of data, you need to make meaningful decisions

5
00:23.720 --> 00:24.620
on that data.

6
00:25.550 --> 00:31.790
So you'll also want to build and leverage alerts and reports so that you're both notified when an issue occurs,

7
00:32.270 --> 00:37.640
whether it was based on a polling-based detection mechanism or an event-based detection.

8
00:38.520 --> 00:44.160
And in addition, you're going to want some kind of reporting capability that provides you with detail

9
00:44.160 --> 00:50.490
of performance, not only in real-time at this point in time, but over a period of time.

10
00:50.880 --> 00:55.290
So you want historical data available so that you can make meaningful decisions.

11
00:56.220 --> 01:04.260
As an example, if an interface on a router has a utilization of 70% is that good or is that bad?

12
01:05.160 --> 01:10.770
That's difficult to know if you don't have historical data that allows you to build a baseline of what

13
01:10.770 --> 01:12.600
your network typically runs at.

14
01:13.540 --> 01:19.060
If that interface in the last three months has been running at 2% utilization and now suddenly

15
01:19.060 --> 01:24.940
it's running at 90% utilization, you'll know that something has happened on your network that

16
01:24.940 --> 01:28.030
has changed the interface utilization dramatically.

17
01:29.010 --> 01:34.740
So you're going to want reports to give you performance detail over time, as well as notify you of

18
01:34.740 --> 01:38.340
issues and the availability of devices in your network.

19
01:39.340 --> 01:44.890
You're going to want to, at a glance, be able to see if there's a problem with a network device such

20
01:44.890 --> 01:50.620
as a router or if there's a problem with an individual interface on one of your routers.

21
01:51.730 --> 01:58.480
Don't forget to set the polling frequency and how granular your event notifications are.

22
01:59.500 --> 02:05.290
This will vary from one environment to another and often depends on the type of topology that you have,

23
02:05.770 --> 02:12.580
the bandwidth available and the resources you have to detect and then act on the information that you're

24
02:12.580 --> 02:13.180
receiving.

25
02:14.050 --> 02:19.810
In addition, you might need to make decisions on how quickly you need to react to an issue on your

26
02:19.810 --> 02:20.350
network.

27
02:21.350 --> 02:28.160
If something happens on your network and it effects an entire building or the entire organization,

28
02:28.340 --> 02:30.260
you're going to want to act on that quickly.

29
02:30.920 --> 02:35.930
But if something happens and it only affects a single device, that's not important, it's probably

30
02:35.930 --> 02:41.810
not as important that you get woken up at three o'clock in the morning to tell you that the port on the

31
02:41.810 --> 02:42.800
switch has gone down.
