Another important topic to discuss is the impact of the network topology on your network monitoring

1
00:07.560 --> 00:14.460
if an interface goes down, does it impact the ability of the NMS to collect data from your network

2
00:14.460 --> 00:15.180
devices?

3
00:16.230 --> 00:23.010
So as an example, if you viewed the network topology in something as simple as Visio or within one

4
00:23.010 --> 00:29.550
of your management tools, how would an outage affect the ability of your network management system

5
00:29.550 --> 00:32.490
to collect data from devices in your network?

6
00:33.370 --> 00:39.820
If you had devices at a remote site and you wanted to collect statistics from those devices, how will

7
00:39.820 --> 00:43.810
a link down affect your ability to get to those statistics?

8
00:44.680 --> 00:50.770
If there was only a single link to the remote site and you had a central network management system and

9
00:50.770 --> 00:56.680
the link went down, the NMS would no longer be able to access those devices to collect data.

10
00:57.650 --> 01:05.030
So you may need to deploy a network management collector on the remote site to collect data remotely

11
01:05.030 --> 01:07.970
rather than trying to collect everything from a central site.

12
01:08.920 --> 01:14.410
So this would mean, as an example, that you deploy a distributed network management architecture rather

13
01:14.410 --> 01:18.070
than having a single centralized network management system.

14
01:19.010 --> 01:22.070
This is especially true where you have multiple data centers.

15
01:22.970 --> 01:29.960
In that case, you might want to deploy multiple copies of NPM one in each data center that then forwards

16
01:29.960 --> 01:33.720
data to an enterprise operation console or EOC.

17
01:34.580 --> 01:38.210
So remember, if you can't get to it, you can't monitor it.

18
01:39.150 --> 01:44.160
So it's important that you keep track of your network topology because you need to ensure that you have

19
01:44.160 --> 01:46.950
reachability status when the topology changes.
