Things that may affect your network reachability are access control lists or ACLs and firewall rules.

1
00:08.920 --> 00:15.430
In many networks that aren't actively being managed, you'll find that security engineers have blocked

2
00:15.430 --> 00:18.190
protocols such as SNMP and ICMP.

3
00:19.090 --> 00:25.690
Those two protocols are very important network management protocols, but for security reasons, they

4
00:25.690 --> 00:31.000
may have been blocked in various points in the network by security-conscious engineers.

5
00:31.600 --> 00:38.770
So it's important that when you're starting to audit the network in preparation to a NMS rollout that

6
00:38.770 --> 00:43.390
you pay special attention to where traffic is allowed and where it's denied.

7
00:44.140 --> 00:51.490
Now, from a best practice point of view, it's ideal to deploy a management VLAN which is separate

8
00:51.670 --> 00:54.310
to the VLANs used for user traffic.

9
00:55.390 --> 01:02.410
So a separate network or separate VLAN is created and network management traffic is permitted on that

10
01:02.410 --> 01:02.950
VLAN.

11
01:03.790 --> 01:11.500
So ACLs and firewall rules on network devices would allow network management protocols on that VLAN

12
01:11.800 --> 01:15.490
and allow an NMS to access the loopback of a router

13
01:15.490 --> 01:22.240
as an example, just be aware that if you limit access to network devices from only specific IP addresses.

14
01:22.660 --> 01:27.970
So as an example, you only allow the IP address of the network management system to access the routers

15
01:27.970 --> 01:30.340
loopback interface using SNMP.

16
01:31.490 --> 01:38.090
When you change things in your network, such as expanding the network management applications, you

17
01:38.090 --> 01:43.660
may need to go back and adjust your access lists or adjust your firewall rules.

18
01:44.210 --> 01:50.930
So it may be simpler to permit a subnet access to your network devices rather than locking it down to

19
01:50.930 --> 01:52.340
an individual IP address.

20
01:53.030 --> 01:58.750
In the same way, when discussing security, you need to pay attention to different security zones.

21
01:59.120 --> 02:05.720
That customer may have an outside interface on a firewall and inside interface and a DMZ interface

22
02:05.990 --> 02:07.130
on their firewall.

23
02:07.790 --> 02:11.430
These security zones can impact your network management systems.

24
02:11.990 --> 02:18.830
So you need to understand how are you going to deploy the NMS and how security rules and firewall

25
02:18.830 --> 02:25.560
zones are going to affect overall reachability and the management strategy that you deploy. Now

26
02:25.580 --> 02:31.190
last but not least, you need to think about overlapping and non-routable addresses in your network.

27
02:32.060 --> 02:37.430
Overlapping and unreadable addresses can be a real headache when deploying network management systems.

28
02:38.240 --> 02:44.030
You should audit your network and understand which addresses are reachable and from where in the network

29
02:44.420 --> 02:51.560
and take that into account as you start documenting the systems and decide where to roll out your network

30
02:51.560 --> 02:52.400
management system.

31
02:53.210 --> 02:59.090
In many cases, if you have overlapping address space and you have devices on each of those overlapping

32
02:59.090 --> 03:06.770
subnets that you need to monitor, you'll need to create a separate polling engine for NPM for each

33
03:06.770 --> 03:08.960
duplicate address space zone.
