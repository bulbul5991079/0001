Another key area of network management planning is knowing how to build and leverage reports.

1
00:07.600 --> 00:14.710
Now, the NPM report writer makes it quite easy to create various types of reports, but it's worthwhile

2
00:14.710 --> 00:21.100
having a look at seeing which reports are available for you and how you can customize those for different

3
00:21.100 --> 00:22.240
business requirements.

4
00:23.110 --> 00:29.680
Now, baselines are important when you're doing capacity planning or doing service level agreement or

5
00:29.680 --> 00:31.120
SLA management.

6
00:32.090 --> 00:38.810
You also want to think about things such as availability, which means how much a network is up during

7
00:38.810 --> 00:40.160
that period of measurement.

8
00:41.110 --> 00:47.560
You also want to think about performance and capacity planning as an example, with availability, you

9
00:47.560 --> 00:52.240
need to understand the term 5 9s or 4 9s.

10
00:53.050 --> 00:59.980
What 5 9s simply means is that during the period of a year, as an example, the network is up 

11
00:59.980 --> 01:03.970
99.999% of the time.

12
01:04.390 --> 01:06.910
In other words, there are five nines in that number.

13
01:07.860 --> 01:11.450
That equates to about five minutes of downtime per year.
