Before you rush out and deploy a network management system in a production environment, think about

1
00:06.660 --> 00:08.100
network management planning.

2
00:09.270 --> 00:15.630
In the lab, such as with GNS3 this is perhaps not as important, but it's very important when doing

3
00:15.630 --> 00:16.680
this in the real world.

4
00:17.720 --> 00:24.620
Network management planning includes translating business requirements into monitoring needs, thresholds,

5
00:25.740 --> 00:29.970
and network performance monitor or NPM configurations.

6
00:31.000 --> 00:37.210
Other things to consider with network management planning include building and leveraging reports that

7
00:37.210 --> 00:44.890
meet the needs of the various stakeholders, as well as determining and monitoring scope and impact

8
00:44.890 --> 00:45.650
on the network.

9
00:46.300 --> 00:52.750
And don't forget about the network topology having an impact on the actual monitoring system.

10
00:53.590 --> 01:00.910
Translating business requirements means doing things such as surveying key stakeholders and departments

11
01:01.510 --> 01:03.460
for their monitoring and reporting needs.

12
01:04.590 --> 01:10.470
It also means documenting goals for your network management system, and this really needs to be stressed.

13
01:10.890 --> 01:15.960
It's very important that you document the goals of your network management system.

14
01:16.870 --> 01:23.350
Otherwise, how do you determine if the network management system deployment has achieved what you set

15
01:23.350 --> 01:24.160
out to do?

16
01:24.940 --> 01:30.450
An organization may have the goal of increasing the availability of the network.

17
01:31.120 --> 01:38.320
However, if you don't document those goals and don't baseline your network before you deploy your network

18
01:38.320 --> 01:44.740
management system, how will you determine if the network management system has had a positive effect

19
01:45.100 --> 01:45.970
on the network?

20
01:46.900 --> 01:49.360
And what it was originally intended to do.

21
01:50.990 --> 01:56.930
It's important that your goals be documented before you deploy and in addition, make sure that you

22
01:56.930 --> 01:58.640
have a baseline of the network.

23
01:58.970 --> 02:04.820
In other words, you have an indication of what the network looks like in its current form before you

24
02:04.820 --> 02:06.620
deploy the network management system.

25
02:07.730 --> 02:14.000
If you don't do that, how will you know three months from today or six months from today, whether

26
02:14.000 --> 02:21.230
the network management system has had a positive effect on the network and has accomplished what it

27
02:21.230 --> 02:22.930
was originally intended to do?

28
02:24.160 --> 02:31.750
Key measures also include things like data granularity, in other words, how granular or detailed should

29
02:31.750 --> 02:33.680
the data be that you're collecting?

30
02:34.450 --> 02:40.750
For example, if you are looking at bandwidth utilization on an interface, how often are you importing

31
02:40.750 --> 02:41.300
that data?

32
02:41.860 --> 02:45.520
Is it once every five minutes or once every five seconds?

33
02:46.120 --> 02:52.150
If you only look at the bandwidth utilization of an interface every five minutes, you may miss a spike

34
02:52.360 --> 02:53.990
during that five minute interval.

35
02:54.640 --> 03:01.150
On the flip side, if you are collecting data every second, you may end up storing a very large amount

36
03:01.150 --> 03:01.690
of data.

37
03:02.590 --> 03:08.920
Another thing to keep in mind when translating business requirements into monitoring needs is data retention,

38
03:09.580 --> 03:15.610
data retention means how long are you going to keep the data that your network management system collected

39
03:16.390 --> 03:19.000
before it's either deleted or summarized?

40
03:20.010 --> 03:26.430
In other words, how long are you going to keep detailed records of your network before it's deemed

41
03:26.790 --> 03:32.490
unnecessary to keep that data or at least that level of detail of the data?

42
03:33.180 --> 03:38.700
Other things you're going to want to do in documenting these monitoring needs is to define both the

43
03:38.700 --> 03:43.400
needs of the teams involved in projects and the thresholds.

44
03:44.310 --> 03:51.810
Now, what thresholds mean is the level at which you want to start seeing error states or paying more

45
03:51.810 --> 03:52.410
attention.

46
03:53.330 --> 04:00.710
If an interface is running at 25% utilization and then goes up to 50% utilization you

47
04:00.710 --> 04:02.770
may not want to be notified of that.

48
04:03.410 --> 04:09.920
But when it goes to 90% utilization, you may want to be informed that something's happened on

49
04:09.920 --> 04:10.540
your network.

50
04:11.330 --> 04:17.480
So you need to decide the thresholds before you get notified of possible problems on your network.

51
04:18.290 --> 04:25.010
This becomes important when you build your alerts and configure the different reports available in NPM.

52
04:25.590 --> 04:32.000
NPM of course has many options and settings that you can change based on your network as well as

53
04:32.000 --> 04:33.380
your business requirements.
