00:06.440 --> 00:10.880
In this lab, we've been told to configure both syslog and NTP.

1
00:11.570 --> 00:14.780
The first thing we need to do is configure the syslog server.

2
00:15.060 --> 00:18.170
So I'll click on the syslog server, go to services.

3
00:19.340 --> 00:29.050
Click syslog and enable the syslog server, the IP address of the syslog server is 10.1.1.200.

4
00:29.720 --> 00:34.010
You could also see that by using the IP config command.

5
00:35.430 --> 00:42.120
In command prompt on the syslog server we then need to configure both router 1 and switch

6
00:42.120 --> 00:44.700
1 to log messages to the syslog server.

7
00:45.210 --> 00:52.320
Before I do that, I'll go back to services and ensure that I can see the syslog server.

8
00:54.170 --> 00:54.710
Here's router

9
00:54.740 --> 01:03.620
1, can I ping the syslog server? It's important to verify that you have IP connectivity to the syslog

10
01:03.620 --> 01:06.860
server and we do here, so that's good.

11
01:09.330 --> 01:14.100
So what I can do is go to global configuration mode and type logging.

12
01:15.950 --> 01:21.080
And specify the host that I'm going to log messages to.

13
01:22.050 --> 01:30.420
Which is 10.1.1.200, type End and notice we see messages on the syslog server.

14
01:31.930 --> 01:35.930
We can see that this device was configured from the console.

15
01:36.850 --> 01:40.090
We can also see that logging has been started.

16
01:40.990 --> 01:46.750
So on the router show IP interface brief, this is the IP address of the router.

17
01:49.270 --> 01:55.850
That's the device that logged messages to the syslog server and here are the messages that were logged.

18
01:56.740 --> 01:59.520
So again, control zed or control Z.

19
02:00.130 --> 02:06.880
This message has been logged to the syslog server notice  no time stamps are displayed.

20
02:07.600 --> 02:09.040
Now let's configure the switch.

21
02:12.060 --> 02:19.490
Something very similar will be done ping 10.1.1.200 we've got IP connectivity to the syslog

22
02:19.560 --> 02:20.060
server.

23
02:20.460 --> 02:25.260
So logging host 10.1.1.200

24
02:28.410 --> 02:36.430
type end, notice these messages are displayed on the console, but they are also displayed on the syslog

25
02:36.450 --> 02:42.600
server IP address of the switch is 10.1.1.253.

26
02:43.110 --> 02:48.240
We can verify that by using the show IP interface brief command.

27
02:48.870 --> 02:53.800
So that device has logged messages to the syslog server.

28
02:54.810 --> 03:00.570
Now we can do some additional tests, such as creating a loopback interface on the router, shutting

29
03:00.720 --> 03:06.810
that down and re-enabling it, as well as shutting this port down on the switch

30
03:07.940 --> 03:15.020
but we can already see that messages are being logged to the syslog server. So on the router,

31
03:15.290 --> 03:25.070
conft interface loopback 0, notice we're told that this interface has come up line protocol

32
03:25.220 --> 03:25.790
is up.

33
03:26.850 --> 03:32.910
In other words, those messages have been logged to the syslog server. I'll create an IP address

34
03:32.910 --> 03:37.800
here and I'll shut the interface down.

35
03:38.490 --> 03:39.780
Interface has gone down

36
03:42.190 --> 03:51.280
and that's what we can see on the syslog server, again, no shut the interface we can see that

37
03:51.370 --> 03:52.570
the interface has come up.

38
03:54.820 --> 03:57.260
Shut it down, no shut it.

39
03:57.850 --> 03:59.740
We can see those log messages.

40
04:01.470 --> 04:04.290
On the switch show, IP interface brief.

41
04:06.770 --> 04:14.960
This interface is currently up, so interface gigabit 104, shut it down.

42
04:15.800 --> 04:19.280
Notice we're told that the interface has gone down.

43
04:19.820 --> 04:23.440
It's been administratively shut down again.

44
04:23.600 --> 04:26.900
Those messages have been logged to the syslog server.

45
04:27.320 --> 04:29.900
No shut it, interfaces come up

46
04:30.440 --> 04:33.560
and that's what we can see on the syslog server.

47
04:34.130 --> 04:39.920
So I've now completed the configuration and verification of syslog in this lab.

48
04:40.470 --> 04:47.130
These two devices, router 1 and switch 1 can log messages to the syslog server.

49
04:47.750 --> 04:50.120
Now we need to configure NTP

50
04:52.420 --> 04:57.040
because no timestamps are shown on these log messages.
