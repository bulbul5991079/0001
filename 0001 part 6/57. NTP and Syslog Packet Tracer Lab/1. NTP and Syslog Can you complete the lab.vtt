In this packet tracer lab, you need to configure both syslog and NTP or network time protocol.

1
00:14.930 --> 00:22.700
This lab consists of a Cisco router and a Cisco switch, as well as a syslog server, NTP server

2
00:23.030 --> 00:33.680
and PC. Syslog allows us to centralize log messages, as well as store a historical backup of various

3
00:33.770 --> 00:41.000
log messages, rather than just logging messages to the console of a router or switch or logging it

4
00:41.360 --> 00:42.870
to a limited buffer

5
00:43.280 --> 00:47.000
we can centralize log messages on a syslog server.

6
00:47.600 --> 00:55.220
Hard drive capacities in servers are much greater than the memory or flash available in routers and

7
00:55.220 --> 01:02.180
switches so we can collate, centralize and store log messages on a syslog server.

8
01:02.840 --> 01:05.090
So that's what you're going to configure in this lab.

9
01:05.570 --> 01:12.440
You're also going to make sure that your log messages have the correct time by setting up an NTP server.

10
01:12.950 --> 01:13.400
Network

11
01:13.400 --> 01:20.120
time protocol allows us to ensure that the devices throughout our network have the correct time, which

12
01:20.120 --> 01:22.490
is important when you're logging messages.

13
01:23.150 --> 01:28.580
If you have a log message that says that an interface went down, that it doesn't really help you if

14
01:28.580 --> 01:31.280
you don't know when that event occurred.

15
01:31.820 --> 01:33.290
Did it happen yesterday?

16
01:33.290 --> 01:34.700
Did it happen a year ago?

17
01:35.120 --> 01:36.710
Did it happen five years ago?

18
01:37.040 --> 01:43.130
It's important that you have timestamps on your log messages, and that's why you need to configure

19
01:43.130 --> 01:46.750
a network time protocol server or NTP server.

20
01:47.420 --> 01:54.260
What you need to firstly do is configure the syslog server to accept syslog messages and then configure

21
01:54.260 --> 02:01.820
router 1 and switch 1 to log messages to the syslog server to test this, create a loopback interface on

22
02:01.820 --> 02:06.680
router 1 and verify that syslog messages are displayed on the syslog server.

23
02:07.250 --> 02:13.730
Do various tests, such as shutting down the loopback interface on the router and then re enabling

24
02:13.730 --> 02:19.580
the loopback interface and make sure that the syslog messages are displayed on the syslog

25
02:19.590 --> 02:28.220
server. Shut this interface on the switch and then re-enable it and once again verify that the 

26
02:28.220 --> 02:31.850
syslog messages are shown on the syslog server.

27
02:32.690 --> 02:36.000
Setting up a syslog server is very easy in packet tracer

28
02:36.000 --> 02:43.460
select users log server, go to services syslog and enable the syslog server.

29
02:44.480 --> 02:50.480
Once you've configured your syslog server, you need to configure the NTP server. So ensure that

30
02:50.480 --> 02:55.160
NTP is enabled on your server, go to services

31
02:56.120 --> 03:00.260
NTP and enable the NTP service.

32
03:02.180 --> 03:11.090
Before you configure your devices to get time from the NTP server, check what the time is on your

33
03:11.090 --> 03:13.610
devices. As an example

34
03:15.870 --> 03:25.000
on the router show clock shows us that this router believes that it's the 1st of March, 1993.

35
03:25.710 --> 03:27.170
That's obviously incorrect.

36
03:28.400 --> 03:38.750
Also, configure router 1 and switch 1 to set timestamps in the syslog messages sent to the syslog server and then

37
03:38.750 --> 03:43.530
configure router 1 and switch 1 to get to that time from the NTP server.

38
03:44.210 --> 03:50.390
Once you've done that, verify that the clocks are properly set and then shut down the loopback interface

39
03:50.390 --> 03:58.250
and re-enable it on router 1 and verify that your syslog server is receiving the syslog messages

40
03:58.610 --> 04:06.260
but in addition verify that the timestamps on the syslog messages are set to correctly do the

41
04:06.260 --> 04:08.420
same on the switch, shutdown

42
04:08.420 --> 04:16.080
and no shut the interface and verify that the syslog messages have the correct timestamp applied.

43
04:16.940 --> 04:26.660
It's important for you to know both syslog and NTP for the CCNA exam, as well as for the real world.

44
04:27.020 --> 04:34.790
So make sure that you know how to configure both syslog and NTP by downloading the packet tracer

45
04:34.790 --> 04:38.290
file and configuring this network.

46
04:39.110 --> 04:45.980
So can you complete this lab? Download the packet tracer file and see if you can complete the lab

47
04:45.980 --> 04:46.610
yourself.

48
04:47.090 --> 04:50.480
Otherwise, watch the next video where I complete the lab.
