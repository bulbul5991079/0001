00:06.260 --> 00:14.930
The first thing I need to do is configure the NTP server, so on the NTP server, go to NTP

1
00:15.910 --> 00:18.490
and I'll enable the NTP servers.

2
00:19.550 --> 00:22.520
I'm not going to enable authentication at this point.

3
00:23.180 --> 00:28.280
I can then specify the date and time this is OK for this lab.

4
00:29.520 --> 00:37.880
The clock on the local PC is the 12th of April, 2018 time is 4:38 AM. 

5
00:40.080 --> 00:49.260
We're told to check the time on the router in the switch first, at the moment show clock shows us that

6
00:49.350 --> 00:51.930
the router thinks it's 1993.

7
00:54.360 --> 01:02.520
The switch thinks it's also 1993, so the time is wrong on both of these devices.

8
01:03.770 --> 01:10.760
Before we configure NTP let's send time-stamped messages to the syslog server.

9
01:14.370 --> 01:22.620
So at the moment, the Syslog server is not showing timestamps on Syslog messages. So on

10
01:22.680 --> 01:30.690
the router, I'm going to type service timestamps, log messages, date and time,

11
01:31.900 --> 01:41.170
and milliseconds, notice the difference now when I type end we can see the date and time on the syslog message,

12
01:41.620 --> 01:46.360
but it's the wrong date and time, so that doesn't really help us with troubleshooting.

13
01:47.060 --> 01:49.860
We want to know when something took place.

14
01:51.040 --> 01:54.940
So we want  date and time as well as milliseconds

15
01:55.690 --> 02:00.550
but again, the switch is showing the wrong date and time, so we need to fix that.

16
02:02.780 --> 02:03.740
So on the router

17
02:06.000 --> 02:13.020
NTP server we need to specify the IP address of the NTP server.

18
02:15.620 --> 02:24.770
NTP server has this IP address, 10.1.1.201, so specify IP address of NTP server.

19
02:26.060 --> 02:35.660
When I type end now and press enter notice of the correct date and time is displayed on the syslog message.

20
02:36.630 --> 02:46.200
It's the 12th of April, 2018, the time is 4:42 AM. So that's good, configure the switch.

21
02:47.580 --> 02:58.350
So NTP server 10.1.1.201, type end notice of the corrected date and time is

22
02:58.350 --> 02:59.000
displayed.

23
02:59.520 --> 03:03.330
We're getting messages from both the router and the switch.

24
03:04.230 --> 03:10.650
We're told to verify the date and time on the road and switch. So on

25
03:10.650 --> 03:19.050
the router, show clock shows the correct date and time on the switch show clock shows the correct date

26
03:19.050 --> 03:19.620
and time.

27
03:20.730 --> 03:28.260
We're then told to shut and enable the loopback interface and shut and enable the ethernet interface on

28
03:28.260 --> 03:33.000
the switch to verify that the syslog messages are correct.

29
03:34.690 --> 03:35.820
I've done that already

30
03:37.330 --> 03:44.710
but to demonstrate it again, when I go into the loopback  interface and I shut the interface

31
03:44.710 --> 03:50.650
down, we can see that the interface went down at the correct date and time.

32
03:52.780 --> 03:57.910
No shut interface has come up at the correct date and time.

33
03:58.660 --> 04:05.470
So we see the corrected date and time on the router as well as on the syslog server.

34
04:06.520 --> 04:12.400
Same thing should happen on the switch, shut interface F104

35
04:15.310 --> 04:16.900
show IP interface brief.

36
04:18.370 --> 04:23.800
This is the interface I want to shut down to gigabit interface, not fast Ethernet so interface gigabit

37
04:24.280 --> 04:30.990
104, shut that down rather than no shut interface has gone down.

38
04:31.540 --> 04:35.830
We can see the interface has gone down at the state in time.

39
04:36.370 --> 04:37.090
No, shut it

40
04:38.040 --> 04:39.060
interfaces come up

41
04:40.020 --> 04:48.860
at the state and time, so again, the switch is displaying the correct time and so is the syslog server.

42
04:49.680 --> 04:52.280
So I've successfully completed this lab.

43
04:52.890 --> 05:00.360
I've been able to configure the router and the switch to use an NTP server to get the correct

44
05:00.450 --> 05:04.870
date and time and to log messages to syslog server.

45
05:05.490 --> 05:07.630
Were you able to complete this lab?

46
05:08.250 --> 05:17.130
Again, it's important for you to know both syslog and NTP for the CCNA exam as well as for the real

47
05:17.130 --> 05:17.670
world.

48
05:18.150 --> 05:24.660
Make sure that you understand how to configure both syslog and NTP.
