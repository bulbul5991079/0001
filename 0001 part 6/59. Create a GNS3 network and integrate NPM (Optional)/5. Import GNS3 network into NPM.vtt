0
00:00.820 --> 00:09.520
So our network is working, so we've integrated the NPM VM with our GNS 3 topology, we've

1
00:09.520 --> 00:11.110
tested IP connectivity.

2
00:12.910 --> 00:23.980
So now we can connect to NPM and login, so URL to use is localhost:8787 or alternatively

3
00:23.980 --> 00:25.750
the hostname of your PC.

4
00:26.940 --> 00:33.510
The default username is Admin the default password is no password, in other words, blank that's

5
00:33.510 --> 00:40.650
shown here, and you can change that by going to settings, manage accounts.

6
00:41.250 --> 00:47.610
I'm going to login with those default values and now we can start our network discovery.

7
00:48.000 --> 00:49.200
So I'm going to click start.

8
00:51.610 --> 01:00.370
We can discover devices by using a small subnet such as /24 or by specifying individual IP addresses.

9
01:00.910 --> 01:09.070
I'm going to add a range of addresses so 10.1.100.1 to 10.1.100

10
01:09.460 --> 01:10.300
.3.

11
01:13.250 --> 01:14.180
I'm gonna click next.

12
01:15.400 --> 01:18.040
I'll make this a bit bigger, so it's easier to read.

13
01:21.730 --> 01:27.820
Next, we're told that NPM can check all notes currently polling with agents for updates by selecting

14
01:28.750 --> 01:34.660
by selecting this option, all notes currently polling via an agent will be pulled for updates.

15
01:35.350 --> 01:41.560
The setting is helpful when using scheduled discoveries to keep agent updates current.

16
01:41.830 --> 01:44.050
So I'm going to select that option and click next.

17
01:45.520 --> 01:53.820
Do we want to log in to ESXI so we can poll VMware and add our vCenter or ESX credentials?

18
01:53.830 --> 01:54.790
I'm going to click next.

19
01:55.940 --> 02:03.320
Now, by default SNMP or simple network management protocol will use a public and private community

20
02:03.320 --> 02:05.490
value for accessing devices.

21
02:06.140 --> 02:07.580
Now we configured

22
02:08.950 --> 02:09.550
our routers.

23
02:13.460 --> 02:21.770
So show run pipe include SNMP with a community value of NPM, so we need to add a new credential

24
02:21.770 --> 02:22.100
here.

25
02:25.670 --> 02:28.220
The value is going to be NPM, 

26
02:30.120 --> 02:39.000
click add so there it is, click next, we can add Windows credentials if we want to allow solar

27
02:39.000 --> 02:47.150
winds NPM to collect C.P.U memory and volume data from Windows servers that don't support SNMP.

28
02:47.550 --> 02:47.970
For now

29
02:47.970 --> 02:48.930
I'm not going to do that.

30
02:48.960 --> 02:49.950
I'm going to click next.

31
02:51.360 --> 02:57.630
We asked how we would like to set up what to monitor so manually set up monitoring of the devices are

32
02:57.630 --> 03:02.580
discovered automatically monitor based on my defined monitoring settings.

33
03:04.390 --> 03:08.440
I'm going to leave it at the default of manual, click next.

34
03:10.610 --> 03:17.000
Now, at any point, you can go back through the wizard, so at the moment I'm at discovery settings,

35
03:17.030 --> 03:20.180
I could click back to go to monitoring settings.

36
03:21.740 --> 03:27.080
So as an example, I might want to include devices that respond to pings alone.

37
03:29.730 --> 03:30.420
Click next.

38
03:31.400 --> 03:33.960
Details of my discovery are shown here.

39
03:34.340 --> 03:36.590
I'm going to accept the defaults and click next.

40
03:37.670 --> 03:44.330
I'm asked how often I want to do the polling that could be hourly, daily, or other options.

41
03:44.340 --> 03:46.100
I'm going to select once only

42
03:46.730 --> 03:49.570
and I want to run the discovery right now.

43
03:49.580 --> 03:51.380
So click discover,

44
03:51.980 --> 03:57.950
the discovery process is then started and you can see here that three notes have been discovered.

45
03:59.510 --> 04:02.600
You can see the overall progress indicator.

46
04:04.330 --> 04:11.160
So at this point, three routers were discovered and one Windows 7 workstation was discovered, click

47
04:11.260 --> 04:11.680
next.

48
04:13.480 --> 04:18.220
Now, which interfaces should be monitored by default, up interfaces are monitored.

49
04:19.300 --> 04:27.040
The port mode of trunk access or unknown is going to be monitored and physical, virtual, and unknown

50
04:27.040 --> 04:28.630
interfaces are going to be monitored.

51
04:29.880 --> 04:33.270
We can see a list of interfaces, so as an example, 

52
04:34.460 --> 04:41.000
on router 1 FastEthernet 0/0 is up, but FastEthernet 1/0 is down.

53
04:41.900 --> 04:46.400
So my various interfaces, including serial interfaces, are shown here.

54
04:47.810 --> 04:55.160
Other interfaces are also listed, such as null zero, as well as the loopback interfaces of the devices.

55
04:56.260 --> 05:02.560
As an example, show IP interface brief on router 1 shows a list of interfaces.

56
05:03.550 --> 05:08.590
So you can see the FastEthernet interfaces and serial interfaces.

57
05:10.990 --> 05:20.020
So that interface information has been picked up by the solarwinds NPM application, click next on my

58
05:20.290 --> 05:29.260
PC, I can view RAM virtual memory, fixed disk space, and other options. Here's the import preview so we

59
05:29.260 --> 05:30.820
can decide what we want to import.

60
05:30.970 --> 05:36.310
I'm going to import my routers as well as the Windows machine, and you can see that information is

61
05:36.310 --> 05:39.940
now being imported into the database.

62
05:40.510 --> 05:41.950
The import has finished.

63
05:42.070 --> 05:43.360
So I'm going to click finish.

64
05:45.260 --> 05:47.690
So going to my dashboard's summary.

65
05:49.520 --> 05:58.430
I can see that I have three Cisco routers, router 1, router 2, and router 3.

66
06:01.440 --> 06:08.640
An unknown device has also been picked up, that is the additional IP address on my local Windows PC.

67
06:10.110 --> 06:15.690
I can also see that I have issues connecting to Google.com as an example.

68
06:17.780 --> 06:20.120
So let's click on one of the routers, router 1.

69
06:22.300 --> 06:29.350
You can see the note is up, can see the IP address, machine type description, and other information

70
06:29.590 --> 06:31.240
about the router.

71
06:32.300 --> 06:41.470
Including, as an example, interface utilization, that's how you get NPM integrated with a GNS 3 network,

72
06:42.110 --> 06:47.810
not only is NPM a very powerful application and we'll look at some of the features as we go through the

73
06:47.810 --> 06:55.160
course, but it also helps you learn practically simple network management protocol and the management

74
06:55.160 --> 06:57.890
of network devices using a management station.
