0
00:00.950 --> 00:05.330
So our topology is connected, I'll start up all the devices.

1
00:06.800 --> 00:11.750
What you'll notice is NPM is starting, the GNS3 VM is starting.

2
00:13.920 --> 00:19.650
So the NPM Windows machine is booted up, the GNS3 VM is booted up

3
00:20.800 --> 00:25.630
and what I'll do now is open up a console connection to the routers. 

4
00:27.340 --> 00:35.290
So let's start with router 1, what I'm going to do is configure this network as 10.1.1.

5
00:35.970 --> 00:38.110
0/24.

6
00:41.110 --> 00:50.710
This network will be 10.1.2.0/24, and this one, 10.1.3.0/24.

7
00:51.980 --> 00:54.890
I'll also create loop backs on each router

8
00:55.950 --> 01:02.910
with an IP address that relates to their name. So quadruple 1 for router 1, 

9
01:04.570 --> 01:06.880
quadruple 2 for router 2,

10
01:08.470 --> 01:11.590
and quadruple 3 for router 3.

11
01:13.720 --> 01:20.470
Loopbacks are great, these are logical interfaces that don't go down on routers and are very useful for

12
01:20.500 --> 01:25.780
for management as well as for protocols such as OSPF. So on router 1

13
01:28.010 --> 01:30.980
create the loopback interface. So quadruple 1

14
01:34.550 --> 01:45.860
go into the first serial interface, serial 0/0 IP address 10.1.1.1/24 no shut it, go on

15
01:45.860 --> 01:52.850
to the second interface serial 0/1 IP address 10.1.2.1,

16
01:54.890 --> 01:56.420
no shut that interface.

17
01:59.360 --> 02:05.180
I'm going to enable my EIGRP, so router EIGRP 100 network

18
02:07.300 --> 02:16.480
and I'm going to enable EIGRP in all interfaces and disable automatic summarization. The important

19
02:16.480 --> 02:21.810
step from a management point of view is to enable SNMP.

20
02:22.570 --> 02:30.010
So I'm going to say SNMP server community and I'm going to specify a community of NPM

21
02:31.250 --> 02:33.140
and I'm going to set it to Read-Only

22
02:34.430 --> 02:42.350
and then I'm going to save the configuration. Do something similar on router 2, so on router 2

23
02:42.350 --> 02:44.510
loopback 0, IP address

24
02:48.780 --> 02:49.710
quadruple 2,

25
02:52.990 --> 03:00.010
interface serial 0/0, IP address 10.1.1.2

26
03:01.740 --> 03:09.420
no shut it, serial 0/1 IP address 10.1.3.2. 

27
03:11.860 --> 03:23.320
No shut that interface, router EIGRP 100 network and enable EIGRP in all interfaces and disable

28
03:23.320 --> 03:24.850
automatic summarization.

29
03:26.790 --> 03:28.170
Last router, router 3

30
03:31.930 --> 03:33.160
create a loopback interface

31
03:37.040 --> 03:37.940
quadruple 3

32
03:41.210 --> 03:52.130
/32 mask, go into the serial interface IP address 10.1.2.3, no shut

33
03:52.130 --> 03:52.360
it

34
03:53.390 --> 03:58.070
second serial interface IP address 10.1.3.3

35
03:59.620 --> 04:13.120
no shut that interface, enable EIGRP on all interfaces, disable automatic summarization, 

36
04:15.960 --> 04:18.090
neighbor relationships are being established

37
04:21.390 --> 04:30.300
and importantly mustn't forget to type SNMP server community, the community name NPM read-only.

38
04:31.370 --> 04:34.600
Need to do that on both router 2 and router

39
04:34.750 --> 04:47.290
3 SNMP server community, NPM Read-Only, and I'll save the configurations.

40
04:49.530 --> 04:58.410
So that's the initial configuration on our routers, show IP EIGRP neighbors shows me that router

41
04:58.410 --> 05:00.780
2 has 2 neighbor relationships, 

42
05:01.950 --> 05:06.540
router 1 has 2 neighbor relationships, 

43
05:09.950 --> 05:19.310
and so does router 3, router 3 can ping the loopback of router 1 and the loopback of router 2, router 

44
05:19.310 --> 05:26.090
1 can ping the loopback of router 2 and the loopback of router 3.

45
05:27.020 --> 05:34.670
So I have configured this network with IP addresses on the serial interfaces and the routers can ping each

46
05:34.670 --> 05:34.990
other.

47
05:35.450 --> 05:44.210
The next step is to enable the management network and get NPM to manage the devices.

48
05:47.280 --> 05:52.530
So to configure the management interface, I'm going to go in the FastEthernet interface of router

49
05:52.530 --> 06:07.140
1 and give it an IP address of 10.1.100.1/24 mask and save the config, router 2 Fast

50
06:07.140 --> 06:13.460
Ethernet interface given address of 10.1.100.2/24 mask

51
06:15.300 --> 06:16.620
save this config

52
06:19.890 --> 06:30.270
and do something similar on router 3 10.1.100.3/24 mask

53
06:34.190 --> 06:35.990
save the configuration.

54
06:37.820 --> 06:45.140
So our devices have booted up, we've connected NPM to the topology, let's test connectivity from

55
06:45.140 --> 06:45.350
NPM.

56
06:47.000 --> 07:00.080
So here's my NPM Windows Machine IP config shows me the IP address of 10.1.100.100, ping 10.101

57
07:00.830 --> 07:01.430
that's router

58
07:01.430 --> 07:06.590
1 ping succeed, router 2 pings succeed, 

59
07:07.400 --> 07:10.000
router 3 pings succeed.

60
07:10.820 --> 07:18.230
So NPM has IP connectivity to the three routers using the management network.

61
07:18.890 --> 07:23.210
Now let's get NPM to discover the devices.

62
07:23.600 --> 07:25.310
In other words, the three routers.
