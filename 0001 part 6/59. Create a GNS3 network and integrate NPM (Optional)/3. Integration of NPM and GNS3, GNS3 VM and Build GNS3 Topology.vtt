00:00.830 --> 00:09.770
Now, to do the integration with GNS3 on my VM and this is my NPM VM, I'm going to change the 

1
00:09.770 --> 00:15.170
network adapter to use VM Net1 host only.

2
00:16.410 --> 00:27.570
On my physical machine, I have 2 VM net adapters, VM Net1 and VM Net8 previously my virtual

3
00:27.570 --> 00:34.830
machine was bridged to the physical adapter, but to allow it to be controlled by GNS3,

4
00:35.280 --> 00:39.150
I'm going to change it to VM net1 host only.

5
00:39.870 --> 00:50.760
I'm also going to change firewall settings and turn off the firewall so that I can ping the virtual

6
00:50.760 --> 00:53.820
machine from my GNS3 routers

7
00:54.480 --> 00:57.540
that'll just make it easier in the lab to do testing.

8
00:59.530 --> 01:06.210
What I also need to do is shut down the virtual machine so that GNS3 can control it.

9
01:07.090 --> 01:10.260
So once again, I've shut the machine down.

10
01:10.800 --> 01:16.450
I've gone to network adapter settings and set it to use host-only

11
01:18.560 --> 01:24.440
and I've disabled the firewall, what I'll do now is take a snapshot.

12
01:26.170 --> 01:34.540
So that I can revert to it if there are any problems, so NPM installed, I did that quickly and made

13
01:34.540 --> 01:35.170
a mistake.

14
01:35.170 --> 01:36.460
So I'll go to VM

15
01:37.830 --> 01:43.170
snapshot manager and change the name to NPM installed.

16
01:46.290 --> 01:49.680
So now let's configure GNS3 and do the integration.

17
01:50.990 --> 01:59.870
So I'm going to start up GNS3 in windows in this case because I'm using the GNS3 VM it boots

18
02:02.190 --> 02:08.700
So you can see my VM is booting up, it's now successfully booted up and GNS3 then tells me 

19
02:08.700 --> 02:13.320
I can create a project, so I'm going to call this NPM 1.

20
02:16.450 --> 02:24.310
Now, to integrate the NPM virtual machine with GNS3, I need to go to edit preferences in GNS

21
02:24.730 --> 02:25.090
3

22
02:26.520 --> 02:33.640
and I'm going to select VMware VMs because I'm using VMware workstation rather than virtual box.

23
02:34.020 --> 02:35.100
I'm going to click new,

24
02:37.590 --> 02:44.400
and in the VM list I can see my NPM virtual machine, I'm going to click finish and now I'm going

25
02:44.400 --> 02:45.300
to click edit.

26
02:47.710 --> 02:55.600
Go to network and check this option, allow login is free to use any configured VMware adapter.

27
02:57.870 --> 03:06.240
I'm going to leave other settings at their defaults and click OK and click, OK, so what I've now done

28
03:06.240 --> 03:15.240
is integrated NPM with GNS3 and I can build a topology consisting of routers and NPM.

29
03:16.920 --> 03:22.010
In the next few videos, I'm going to show you how to integrate GNS3 and NPM.

30
03:23.040 --> 03:29.910
Now, in this example, I'm using, the GNS3 VM because it's the recommended way of running GNS

31
03:29.910 --> 03:30.270
3.

32
03:31.620 --> 03:40.310
It also makes sense in this example, because I'm running NPM on a Windows seven VM within VMware workstation,

33
03:40.890 --> 03:49.980
So I've got both NPM running in windows and GNS3 running within the GNS3 VM within VMware

34
03:49.980 --> 03:50.730
workstation.

35
03:52.200 --> 03:59.880
The initial topology that we're going to build consists of three routers connected via serial interfaces

36
04:00.090 --> 04:08.070
and we'll advertise routes between these routers using EIGRP will also configure an out-of-band management

37
04:08.070 --> 04:16.890
network and connect NPM to the out-of-band Ethernet network to allow NPM to manage the routers.

38
04:18.980 --> 04:23.780
So to build our GNS3 topology, I'm going to drag 3 routers

39
04:25.050 --> 04:26.130
to the workspace

40
04:30.360 --> 04:32.520
as well as drag an Ethernet switch

41
04:34.300 --> 04:38.980
to the workspace, and I'm going to run to these in the GNS3 VM.

42
04:42.270 --> 04:48.540
I'll cable up the routers using the serial interfaces.

43
04:56.370 --> 04:57.150
So

44
04:58.400 --> 05:01.520
connect the routers via the serial interfaces.

45
05:02.510 --> 05:07.220
I'll zoom in and let's view the interface labels.

46
05:09.910 --> 05:18.820
Serial 0 is connected to serial 0 on router 2, serial 0 on router 1 is connected to serial 0

47
05:19.450 --> 05:26.500
on router 2, serial 0/1 is connected to serial 0/0 on router 3.

48
05:28.170 --> 05:34.800
We'll also connect FastEthernet interfaces on each router to the Ethernet switch.

49
05:36.610 --> 05:39.940
This is going to be used for our management network.

50
05:48.920 --> 05:52.910
So there are interfaces on the switch

51
05:53.830 --> 06:02.050
and interfaces on the routers. I'll now bring NPM into the topology

52
06:04.110 --> 06:11.790
and I'm going to connect that via the Ethernet interface to port 4 on the Ethernet switch.

53
06:14.880 --> 06:22.560
So this allows NPM to manage the road is using the out-of-band management network, I'll configure the

54
06:22.560 --> 06:29.430
routers with IP addresses on the serial interfaces first and enable routing and then I'll configure

55
06:29.430 --> 06:30.660
the management interface.
