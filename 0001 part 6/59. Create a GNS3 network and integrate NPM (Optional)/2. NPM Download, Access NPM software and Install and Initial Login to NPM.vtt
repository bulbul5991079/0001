00:00.240 --> 00:07.020
I previously downloaded the NPM software in this case, I'm using a release candidate 1 version of software,

1
00:07.740 --> 00:09.570
you'll be using the full release.

2
00:10.890 --> 00:18.370
Now that I've downloaded my solar winds software, I need to get it into my virtual machine.

3
00:18.840 --> 00:24.900
There are multiple ways of doing this, but in this example, I'm going to go to VM settings, options,

4
00:25.410 --> 00:27.900
and I'm going to create a shared folder.

5
00:28.320 --> 00:35.040
So I'm going to click add and browse to the folder where I downloaded the software on my physical

6
00:35.040 --> 00:35.640
PC.

7
00:36.420 --> 00:38.670
Click next, click finish.

8
00:39.720 --> 00:47.070
I'm going to make this available as a network drive and click, OK, so now in Windows Explorer, I

9
00:47.070 --> 00:53.190
have a shared folder and within that I can see my installation file.

10
00:53.790 --> 00:59.160
I'll now be able to install solar winds NPM on my Windows 7 VM.

11
01:00.840 --> 01:07.440
So to install NPM, I'm going to double click on the solar winds NPM executable file, this file is

12
01:07.440 --> 01:15.770
once again stored on my physical machine, but I'm accessing it via a shared folder.

13
01:16.230 --> 01:17.220
I'm going to click Run.

14
01:18.940 --> 01:20.500
The install has been verified

15
01:21.370 --> 01:23.230
and then files are being extracted.

16
01:24.410 --> 01:32.330
I'm going to click yes, to allow the program to make changes to the computer. So the solar winds installer

17
01:32.690 --> 01:34.280
is starting the installation.

18
01:36.860 --> 01:45.020
Now, I'm told that solarwinds requires Microsoft.net framework version 4.5, if this version

19
01:45.020 --> 01:52.010
is not already installed, solarwinds will install the required .net framework version before installing

20
01:52.190 --> 01:59.690
your solarwinds application, click install to begin the installation of the Microsoft.net framework.

21
02:00.380 --> 02:07.220
So I'm going to click install to install Microsoft.net now to make sure that you don't get bored with

22
02:07.250 --> 02:08.180
these videos.

23
02:08.270 --> 02:16.120
I'm going to speed up the installation process so some processes are taking a long time to complete.

24
02:16.460 --> 02:18.620
I'm going to simply speed them up in the video.

25
02:19.560 --> 02:27.390
OK, so Microsoft.net has been installed, I'm now shown the welcome wizard for the Orion Network

26
02:27.390 --> 02:28.890
Performance Monitor software.

27
02:29.520 --> 02:31.440
So it says, welcome to the install

28
02:31.450 --> 02:34.320
wizard for Orion Network Performance Monitor.

29
02:35.040 --> 02:36.300
Click next to continue.

30
02:36.300 --> 02:38.490
So I'm going to click next to start the installation.

31
02:39.640 --> 02:41.210
You need to choose your language.

32
02:41.710 --> 02:48.880
In my case, I'm going to select English, I'm told that Orion requires Internet information services

33
02:49.060 --> 02:54.900
or IIS, but it's not currently installed after completing the installation.

34
02:55.210 --> 02:59.140
The Orion configuration was it can install it automatically.

35
02:59.590 --> 03:00.590
Do I want to do this?

36
03:00.610 --> 03:01.590
Yes, I do.

37
03:01.900 --> 03:04.450
So I'm going to continue with the Orion installation.

38
03:06.220 --> 03:08.320
The license agreement is then displayed.

39
03:09.640 --> 03:15.040
It's obviously recommended that you read the license agreement before accepting the terms.

40
03:15.400 --> 03:22.180
I'm going to accept the terms and then click next and then asked to choose a destination installation

41
03:22.180 --> 03:22.880
location.

42
03:23.290 --> 03:26.050
I'm going to stick with the default and click next.

43
03:27.830 --> 03:30.930
They need to choose the install type.

44
03:31.590 --> 03:37.980
I'm not going to use an express install, which is the recommended way of doing it so fully install Orion

45
03:37.980 --> 03:44.280
Network Performance Monitor as quickly as possible, or do an advanced installation. In this case

46
03:44.280 --> 03:47.960
because I simply want to get the software up and running as quickly as possible.

47
03:48.270 --> 03:52.050
I'm going to go for the Express install and click next.

48
03:52.830 --> 04:01.410
NPM now supports QOE or quality of experience traffic monitoring, I'm then asked whether I want to

49
04:01.410 --> 04:05.430
install thi,s in this case because I want to get it up and running quickly.

50
04:05.700 --> 04:11.580
I'm going to select the default values and enable QOE and click next.

51
04:12.360 --> 04:17.250
I'm told that the setup has enough information to start copying the files.

52
04:17.730 --> 04:21.270
If you want to review or change any settings, click back.

53
04:21.720 --> 04:23.870
If you're satisfied, click next.

54
04:24.420 --> 04:25.440
I'm happy with that.

55
04:25.440 --> 04:29.820
So I'm going to click next and start the NPM installation.

56
04:30.790 --> 04:37.720
So NPM is installing various components, including Microsoft Visual C++.

57
04:39.410 --> 04:41.210
The installation takes a while.

58
04:42.140 --> 04:48.170
I'm going to speed up the video so that you don't have to wait for the full installation taking place

59
04:48.170 --> 04:49.250
in real time.

60
04:53.570 --> 04:57.050
We're told now that the installation is being completed.

61
04:58.140 --> 05:05.700
We're now told that the installation has successfully completed, so the database has been set up,

62
05:05.700 --> 05:13.050
the website has been set up, all services are running, and we can launch the Web console by checking

63
05:13.050 --> 05:15.670
the check box, which is checked by default.

64
05:16.440 --> 05:19.770
I'm going to click finish to exit the configuration

65
05:19.770 --> 05:20.220
wizard.

66
05:22.340 --> 05:32.240
I can then connect to the local host on Port 8787, and then log in to the solarwinds NPM server,

67
05:33.050 --> 05:40.700
notice by default, we can log in with the username of admin and no password. To change the admin password

68
05:40.850 --> 05:43.910
to login, click settings, manage accounts.

69
05:44.990 --> 05:50.210
So I'm going to log in with the default username of Admin and a blank password.

70
05:50.780 --> 05:57.820
So at this point I have successfully installed NPM and I can access the console.

71
05:58.610 --> 06:02.410
The next step is to follow the wizard to discover the network.

72
06:02.750 --> 06:09.410
But before I do that, I need to configure the virtual machine for integration with GNS3.
