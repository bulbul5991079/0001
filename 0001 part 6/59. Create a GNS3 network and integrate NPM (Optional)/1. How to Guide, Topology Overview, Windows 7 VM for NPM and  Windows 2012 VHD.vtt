The following videos showing you the integration between GNS3 and NPM are based on this how-to

1
00:07.800 --> 00:14.250
guide, which you can get from the below links. This may be useful to you after you've attended the training.

2
00:14.790 --> 00:22.260
So if you want to set up NPM and GNS3 refer back to this guide which contains a lot of information,

3
00:22.710 --> 00:28.470
including how to install both GNS3 and NPM, how to create the initial topology.

4
00:29.530 --> 00:37.270
The commands used on the routers, including commands such as setting up SNMP, setting up the IP addresses

5
00:37.870 --> 00:45.960
and configuring EIGRP, I'll also include the commands on the routers, on the relevant video in this

6
00:45.970 --> 00:46.480
training

7
00:47.470 --> 00:52.630
but you may find the integration going to be of benefit to you for reference later.

8
00:53.900 --> 01:00.020
In the next few videos, I'm going to show you how to build a topology within GNS3 that consists

9
01:00.020 --> 01:03.320
of three routers connected via serial interfaces.

10
01:04.390 --> 01:10.630
These are going to be the interfaces monitored by Network Performance Monitor. The three Cisco routers

11
01:10.630 --> 01:14.180
are connected to a switch, which in turn is connected to NPM.

12
01:14.800 --> 01:17.900
This is our out-of-band network management subnet.

13
01:18.580 --> 01:23.650
You don't need a dedicated network for management, but in this example, that's the way we're going

14
01:23.650 --> 01:25.510
to configure it. Now

15
01:25.510 --> 01:29.650
in GNS3 there are multiple ways to set up your Cisco routers.

16
01:30.400 --> 01:36.940
You can either run Cisco iOS routers directly within Windows using what's called the local server,

17
01:37.450 --> 01:42.280
or you can use a virtual box VMS or VMware VMS.

18
01:42.910 --> 01:44.680
It's up to you which method to use.

19
01:45.100 --> 01:53.110
The recommendation is that if you are only going to have Cisco routers and other basic devices such

20
01:53.110 --> 02:00.610
as the built-in Ethernet switches in GNS3 you can run GNS3 or locally on your local

21
02:00.610 --> 02:01.960
windows, PC or Mac.

22
02:02.470 --> 02:09.910
However, if you want to run more complex topologies using iOS layer 2 or other more complex setups,

23
02:10.060 --> 02:12.910
then you're going to want to use the GNS3 VM.

24
02:13.480 --> 02:19.960
Please refer to the GNS3 installation videos for more detail on how to set up and integrate

25
02:20.110 --> 02:20.950
GNS3.

26
02:22.240 --> 02:28.860
So in this example, I have a Windows 7 professional virtual machine running within a VMware workstation.

27
02:29.290 --> 02:36.400
I've allocated 4 gig of RAM to the 64 bit operating system and I've allocated 2 calls.

28
02:37.090 --> 02:44.170
So on the settings of a VMware workstation, you can see that 4 gig of RAM has been allocated.

29
02:45.620 --> 02:49.010
At the moment, only one process has been allocated.

30
02:49.760 --> 02:57.740
Now some recommendations from solar winds, you can run NPM on Windows 7, Windows 8.1

31
02:57.740 --> 02:58.910
and Windows 10.

32
02:59.390 --> 03:04.840
It suggested that you use 2 cores and 4 gigs of RAM as the bare minimum.

33
03:05.390 --> 03:12.320
It is better, however, to use 8 giga ram and 4 cores, but as a bare minimum use 2 cores

34
03:12.320 --> 03:13.700
and 4 gigs of RAM.

35
03:15.090 --> 03:21.120
So in this example, I'm going to shut down my virtual machine and I'm going to increase the amount

36
03:21.120 --> 03:28.800
of RAM and CPU so that it's a lot quicker when I do the demonstrations.

37
03:29.280 --> 03:32.640
Now, that's obviously dependent on what you have available

38
03:33.520 --> 03:43.240
on your PC, but I'll set it to use 4 processor cores and 8 gig of ram and I'll power on the virtual

39
03:43.240 --> 03:44.010
machine again.

40
03:45.580 --> 03:50.770
Now, something I always do, and this is up to you, but I always create snapshots

41
03:51.830 --> 03:54.800
of my virtual machines in case something goes wrong.

42
03:57.500 --> 04:05.330
So I've created a snapshot with, for example, a new install of Windows 7 with Chrome installed

43
04:05.780 --> 04:07.460
and that's where I am at the moment.

44
04:08.680 --> 04:12.040
Virtual machine is saying that I need to restart, so I'll do that here.

45
04:15.670 --> 04:23.590
So what I'm simply doing here is getting Windows 7 ready so that I can install NPM.

46
04:26.710 --> 04:35.800
You may also want to download Windows 2012, so as an example, you can download a VHD file and then

47
04:35.800 --> 04:42.730
import that into a virtual box if you want to run NPM on Windows Server 2012.
